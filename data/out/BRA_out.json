It is an instrument that enables UN entities to strategically analyze its operations and identify opportunities to advance on joint operations arrangements, focusing on cost-efficient and effective local solutions. Its implementation foresees to generate important gains in staff working hours as well as important financial savings and aims to increase the quality of operational services in the next years, thus strengthening the overall programme delivery of the UN System in Brazil.\n\nThe BOS Annual Review 2023 aims at reviewing the participant entities, the existing catalogue of common services, assessing the possibility of implementing the highly recommended ones and, finally, reviewing the cost benefit analysis and recording the actual status of implementation of the common services included in the Planning Framework in the areas of Procurement, Logistics, Administration, Finance, Human Resources, and ICT.  Brazil has an estimated cost avoidance of US$2,04 Mi, out of which US$ 1,17Mi already realized.\n\nI would like to commend the UN Operations Management Team and its working groups composed of the entities from the UN System in Brazil on developing this strategy and its annual review for 2023.\n \nSilvia Rucks\n\nUN Resident Coordinator in Brazil"},"participatingEntitites":[{"organizationId":10,"participating":true},{"organizationId":18,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2,"participating":true},{"organizationId":21,"participating":true},{"organizationId":22,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2485,"participating":true},{"organizationId":25,"participating":true},{"organizationId":28,"participating":true},{"organizationId":29,"participating":true},{"organizationId":30,"participating":true},{"organizationId":31,"participating":true},{"organizationId":32,"participating":true},{"organizationId":33,"participating":true},{"organizationId":34,"participating":true},{"organizationId":35,"participating":true},{"organizationId":37,"participating":true},{"organizationId":39,"participating":true},{"organizationId":40,"participating":true},{"organizationId":5,"participating":true},{"organizationId":50,"participating":true},{"organizationId":6,"participating":true},{"organizationId":8,"participating":true}],"planRisks":[{"type":"risk","description":"Initial bottlenecks may create dissatisfaction in the clients","comment":null,"likelihood":"Remote","impact":"Minor","risktreatment":"Accept","mitigationMeasure":null},{"type":"assumption","description":"Agencies use the LTAs.","comment":null,"likelihood":null,"impact":null,"risktreatment":null,"mitigationMeasure":null},{"type":"assumption","description":"Heads of Agencies (HoAs) ensure enough time is allocated to the development and operations of common","comment":null,"likelihood":null,"impact":null,"risktreatment":null,"mitigationMeasure":null},{"type":"assumption","description":"Investment of USD300 per license per year.

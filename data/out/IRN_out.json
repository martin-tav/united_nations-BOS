[{"iso":"IRN","kickoff":{"startDate":"2024-01-01","endDate":"2024-03-31","description":"UN Iran\u2019s Business Operations Strategy (BOS) is developed to contribute to one of the key pillars of the UN Secretary General\u2019s reform agenda \u2013 namely, the repositioning of the UN development system. Together with other system-wide initiatives, such as Common Premises (UNCPs), BOS constitutes a critical tool to help increase efficiencies, improve quality, and reduce unnecessary costs for the UN Country Team and its constituent agencies, funds and programmes. BOS 2.0 has four important features that are worth highlighting:\n\nPractical. Avoiding duplication, exploring economies of scale, and leveraging the bargaining power of \u2018One UN\u2019.\nGradual and flexible. BOS 2.0 adopts a step-by-step approach and allows room for adjustments over time. \nComplementary. BOS 2.0 connects well with other streams of UN development reform \u2013 including corporate initiatives to strengthen UN Common Premises and Common Back Offices.  \nClient-oriented. BOS 2.0 is driven by the need to be responsive to its direct clients - namely individual UN agencies, funds and programmes operating in Iran. \nThe following summarizes the key elements of the strategy:\n\nA. OBJECTIVE: To improve the efficiency of operations across the UN in I.R. Iran \u2013 by avoiding costs, simplifying business processes and improving the quality of operational activities. Ultimately, the intent is to enhance the impact of the UN in I.R. Iran \u2013 by improving the quality of the UN\u2019s work through \u2018smarter\u2019 inter-agency collaboration.\n\nB. METHOD: Strengthen existing common services and introduce new common services \u2013 which capitalize on economies of scale, joint \u2018negotiating power\u2019 and minimizing repetitive and duplicative processes.\n\nC. KEY TARGETS:\nIt is expected to avoid approximately USD 1,000,000 in cost of operations through the enhancement of existing and new shared services during the period 2020-2025.\nIncrease client satisfaction by an average of 25% against the baseline.\nSupport UNCT\u2019s efforts in achieving the SDGs through undertaking High Impact Common Services including Gender responsive procurement, disability inclusive procurement and HR practices, physical and digital accessibility of the UN in Iran, carpooling, and energy consumption, measurement and monitoring (ECCM).\nD. KEY ACTIONS & ACHIEVEMNETS \nProcurement: The on-line vendor databases is maintained and validated and includes markers for businesses that are either managed or owned by women as well as persons with disabilities. New long-term agreements (LTAs) for Ambulance Services during the Medical Evacuation and Internet Connectivity services are established.\nNOTE: It is worth mentioning that on Internet Connectivity services, participating entities have managed to negotiate a 36% reduction in the unit price for Mb\/month. This reduction is not shown in the \u201crealized benefit\u201d in 2022 since the LTA was established in later part of the year and many entities did not have the opportunity to use it. We expect to see larger amounts of cost avoidance in 2023 and 2024.\n\nAdmin and Logistics: In this service area, joint procurement of services such as security, travel and customs clearance is being undertaken. More services such as car-pooling and joint procurement and maintenance of security equipment will be considered in 2023. A number of activities related to environmental sustainability and accessibility are also being undertaken.  \nFinance: Tax management (for applicable tax exemptions and refunds), enhanced HACT management, joint negotiations with banking service providers and enhance internet and mobile banking options for UN agencies are being implemented.\nICT: Joint Helpdesk services and digital accessibility are among the activities being undertaken.\nHuman resources: Strengthened collaboration on common \u2018Duty of Care\u2019 functions, including through joint negotiations with health providers to continue to strengthen the quality of their services to UN personnel and dependents, Gender Parity, staff wellbeing and HR inclusive practices are among common service being implemented in this service line.\nThrough above joint activities, the country team has achieved USD600,000 in actual financial benefits from 2020 to the end of 2022.\n\nFurthermore, several common services are dropped from BOS, since the services in question do not yield significant cost or quality benefits. Even though they will continue to be provided, they will not be included in BOS. They include, among others, Financial Services, Lease Management and Cleaning services.  \n\nUNCT's commitment to BOS activities were commendable in 2021 and 2022. They not only committed considerable staff time by participating in regular Working Groups meetings but also cost shared a consultant to assist the OMT in the implementation of BOS 2021 and 2022 workplan. \n\nSanctions continue to create major challenge for UN operations in Iran and the implementation of BOS workplan, especially in procurement of imported goods and international services such as banking. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the pandemic has created opportunities for moving towards greener UN offices and operations. Some of these opportunities include Car Pooling and Fleet management which, will be explored and implemented in 2023 and beyond.

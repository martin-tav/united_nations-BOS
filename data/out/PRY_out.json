It will reduce internal transaction costs and provide cost savings on externally sourced goods and services. The BOS will build on lessons learned and establish the means for a coordinated approach to \u201cOperating as One\u201d management mechanisms, and by systematically implementing established good practices for the transactions with the highest impact.\n\nThe BOS presents summaries of the operations analysis conducted; shows how the operations analysis provides the foundations for the results framework; demonstrates the causality and interdependence of the activities and outputs; and finally provides an implementation outline that will be incorporated into the Operations Management Team (OMT) annual work plan. The results framework provides measurable outputs, indicators and targets to assist the management, monitoring, evaluation and reporting of the identified common services.\n\nSuch common services will be implemented through lead agency activity, coordinated through the inter-agency working groups of the OMT, with the aim of improving the quality, cost effectiveness and timeliness of the UN System support to programme delivery and business operations."},"participatingEntitites":[{"organizationId":11,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2,"participating":true},{"organizationId":21,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2275,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2485,"participating":true},{"organizationId":25,"participating":true},{"organizationId":30,"participating":true},{"organizationId":32,"participating":true},{"organizationId":33,"participating":true},{"organizationId":35,"participating":true},{"organizationId":42,"participating":true},{"organizationId":50,"participating":true},{"organizationId":6,"participating":true},{"organizationId":7,"participating":true},{"organizationId":8,"participating":true},{"organizationId":962,"participating":true}],"planRisks":[{"type":"assumption","description":"En el presente a\u00f1o ya no podr\u00e1 utilizarse el LTA de Viajes debido al cierre de fronteras.","comment":null,"likelihood":null,"impact":null,"risktreatment":null,"mitigationMeasure":null},{"type":"assumption","description":"ICT - Ante congesti\u00f3n o dificultad de acceso al servicio se proveer\u00e1 una conexi\u00f3n backup al staff cr","comment":null,"likelihood":null,"impact":null,"risktreatment":null,"mitigationMeasure":null},{"type":"assumption","description":"ICT - Cualquier requerimiento que no pueda ser suministrado por el Help Desk; ser\u00e1 realizado por una","comment":null,"likelihood":null,"impact":null,"risktreatment":null,"mitigationMeasure":null},{"type":"assumption","description":"Leaving from the premises of any Agency and the impact at the common services and spaces.","comment":null,"likelihood":null,"impact":null,"risktreatment":null,"mitigationMeasure":null},{"type":"assumption","description":"Standarize the procedure of electronic signature with the bank","comment":null,"likelihood":null,"impact":null,"risktreatment":null,"mitigationMeasure":null}]}]

[{"iso":"SSD","kickoff":{"startDate":"2024-01-01","endDate":"2024-03-31","description":"The UN in South Sudan first developed a Business Operations Strategy (BOS) in 2019 to support efforts to deliver on its Peace-Humanitarian-Development assistance commitments.\n\nThe South Sudan BOS covers the UN system\u2019s joint priorities in the areas of common operations for 2019-2024 with agreed common services in: Administrative and Logistics; Finance; Human Resources; Information Communication Technology (ICT) and Procurement. It builds on ongoing efforts by the UN system in country to harmonize and simplify its business operations and aims to address the gaps identified by the UN General Assembly in strategic planning, coordination and monitoring of the UN\u2019s inter-agency operations and activities.\n\nTo date, under the BOS, cost avoidance amounting to USD 7.5 million has been recorded for the period 2019-2022 with the reported quality of those services also improving. These savings will be continued across the lifetime of the 2023-2025 UNSDCF, realised principally through reduction in recurrent costs and staff time for the acquisition of goods and services either through development of new joint Long-Term Agreements (LTAs) and\/or piggybacking on existing Agreements.\n\nGoing forward, there will also be closer collaboration with UNMISS on BOS implementation and enhanced cooperation between OMT and PMT in particular for the scale-up of HACT. In addition, OMT will seek to further strengthen and streamline operations for reduced costs and improved quality on agreed common services. It will also explore opportunities for additional common services with high impact, such as initiatives on environmental, gender sensitive procurement and Common Premises."},"participatingEntitites":[{"organizationId":11,"participating":true},{"organizationId":18,"participating":true},{"organizationId":19,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2,"participating":true},{"organizationId":21,"participating":true},{"organizationId":22,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2275,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2485,"participating":true},{"organizationId":25,"participating":true},{"organizationId":28,"participating":true},{"organizationId":29,"participating":true},{"organizationId":30,"participating":true},{"organizationId":31,"participating":true},{"organizationId":32,"participating":true},{"organizationId":33,"participating":true},{"organizationId":34,"participating":true},{"organizationId":35,"participating":true},{"organizationId":39,"participating":true},{"organizationId":40,"participating":true},{"organizationId":5,"participating":true},{"organizationId":50,"participating":true},{"organizationId":6,"participating":true},{"organizationId":61,"participating":true},{"organizationId":8,"participating":true}],"planRisks":[{"type":"risk","description":"- Synergies in common training approach can not be agreed upon \n-Duplication of training prpgrammes","comment":null,"likelihood":"Possible","impact":"Minor","risktreatment":"Control","mitigationMeasure":"OMT may discuss and find solutions."},{"type":"risk","description":"Agency may not participate in the common service","comment":null,"likelihood":"Possible","impact":"Slight Concern","risktreatment":"Accept","mitigationMeasure":"OMT may discuss and find solutions."},{"type":"risk","description":"Common LTA to be supported, and partnerships with mobile providers expanded across all agencies.

[{"iso":"CUB","kickoff":{"startDate":"2024-01-01","endDate":"2024-03-31","description":"The UNCT Cuba developed its first business operation strategy (BOS) 2021-2026 looking for a set of efficient and optimized common services that can have a direct impact in both programme delivery and daily operations. This BOS embraces the UN reform with a pragmatic vision responding to the Cuban reality and programmatic needs as outlined in the UNSDCF. The impact of COVID-19, the economic adjustments and reforms initiated in early 2021 in the country, and the restrictions arising from the US embargo, have challenged existing business models and provided an opportunity to advance \u201calternative thinking\u201d for operational mechanisms to contribute to the proposed results of the ongoing Cooperation Framework 2020-2024.\n\nWith this as a basis, the Cuba BOS looks for efficiency through: mitigating duplication of processes; simplifying business practices to save time invested; leveraging resources; creating efficiency in management of offices with the use of technology and lessons learnt from COVID-19 working & business modalities; curtailing transactional costs; and using a renewed set of working principles among staff. The big message in the BOS is neither increasing nor favoring fragmented processes but rather transforming them. \n\nAs a result, Cuba BOS is expected to achieve a cost avoidance of 1.600K USD (5%) through 34 transformed common processes by 2026. The main principles in the implementation exercise will be: fostering the use of mutual recognition; promoting a knowledge and info sharing platform across the OMT; replicating good practices & trendy businesses across UN operations; and favoring flexibility and complementarity among service lines and agency participation. Furthermore, the current BOS seeks to set the basis for the global initiative on Common Premises and the establishment of a Common Back Office, as a seeding strategy in the UN efficiency agenda.\n\nThe BOS has been initiated on July 1st, 2021 and is monitored on annual basis. Common services for future collaboration have been identified in the areas of Administration, Finance, Human Resources, Information & Technology, Logistics and Procurement. The current strategy is bringing together the Office of the RCO and 11 UN entities with physical presence in the country (FAO, IOM, UNESCO, UNDP, UNFPA, UNHABITAT, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNIDO, WHO, WFP). Moreover, 11 non-resident agencies will benefit as well from the common services identified in support of the 2030 agenda implementation.\n \nAmong the BOS service lines, Administration accounts for 72% of the expected total cost avoidance with a repositioning of common premises standards, reinforcement of business continuity, and efficiency in office management considering foreseen business models. Such a weight in the cost avoidance structure is perfectly aligned to country typology for Cuba. Following the challenges in the national context, the Finance pillar will be mainly dealing with banking services given the monetary reform and economic transforming processes launched by the local authorities. Furthermore, HACT micro-assessments are included in this area using a new approach for service provider. On the other hand, Procurement and Logistics are highly related and dependable from one each other. These will tackle clearing mechanisms with national agents for supply imports (considering the risk involved and significant volume of import processes) and joint procurement and acquisition processes for emergency purposes. Additionally, Information and Technology is directly linked to business continuity and is expected to yield qualitive improvements rather than cost avoidance, considering challenges faced in the country with connectivity and related services. Lastly, Human Resources are mainly focused on staff wellbeing given COVID-19 context and new economic reforms implemented in the country. This service line is also incorporating topics directly impacting the SDGs such as PSEA, youth employment, gender and inclusive approach for recruitment processes. \n \nDue to the level of complexity in working arrangements as well as the challenges faced locally, the services time-line for the implementation was carefully reviewed and updated. As a result, common services which were feasible to kick off where planned and carried out such us: those related to the staff wellbeing (Agreements with clinics, procurement of PPE supplies and the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse), local payroll processing, HACT management, banking service as well as those related to the premise management (Joint Business Continuity Plan and management of common services). On the other hand, joint procurement processes, stationery, IT procurement, freight forwarding, travel and conference management are set to be initiated during 2022.\n \nAs per the Annual Review, as at March 31st, 2023, the BOS, at all its stages, was comprehensively assessed in a joint-effort with all UN Agencies involved. The BOS Reviewed, shows the relevant changes and reflect properly the reality of the context which the Agencies operate in. The BOS aims at integrate all feasible work that Agencies can perform together, taking into account the challenges and limitations present in the field, and offer a set of activities and opportunities that can be materialized and derived into an optimizations of the resources and maximization of benefits within the UN System in Cuba. When compared with the last-year revision, the macroeconomic environment remains as challenging as it was, especially in terms of the impact on the operations as a consequence of a rising inflation, which impacts at several spheres: from the cost of living to the budget of the Agencies, and as a result on the programme implementation. The  Furthermore, an as for the period between July 1st, 2021 and March 31st, 2023, a cost avoidance of USD 330K has been achieved as a result of the implementation of the above-mentioned common services. Moreover, it should be highlighted that besides the on-going implementation, a special consideration was given to those common services and indicators linked to the Sustainable Development Goals, for instance Gender Parity and Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse has been closely assessed and an implementation roadmap has been established.\n \nConsultations within OMT were undertaken to calibrate performance levels and implementation timelines in identified operations. These discussions provided an operational assessment as set out in the Opportunity Analysis and in the Planning Framework. Estimated budget for implementation is estimated in 44.8k USD. It is mainly focusing in activities related to BCP, management of common premises, HH.RR. surveys, PPE supplies and HACT. Most of financial requirements are already included in UN entities budgets. Consequently, the budget gap is around 13% and aims to address actions related to common premises realignment and joint BCP basic needs.\n\n\nMain threats for success were identified and grouped into different categories such as contextual, institutional behavior, operational and programmatic. The impact of context elements such as COVID-19, natural disasters, economic crisis, inflation, the creation of new legal actors and frameworks, and US embargo, among others, may severely reduce expected goals from this BOS. Other main institutional factors such as lack of commitment from UN entities, silos in UN entities, not reporting on time and business as usual mindset in the implementation, are considered to possibly hamper operational success of the strategy. Furthermore, operational factors that may negatively influence the implementation of BOS are related to the high level of scarcity in markets, price increase on the oil, and limited providers the UN Cuba can work with, a high dependency on import process for supply procurement, and complex national mechanisms for importation of programme supplies, among others. From the programmatic scope, main threats identified were related to a lack programmatic planning which increases footprint of operational support and transactional costs.\n \nDue to the specific context of Cuba, it is mandatory to give special consideration to the consequences of the US Embargo. The prohibition on the procurement of technological inputs that contain more than 10 per cent of U.S. components remains in force. Similarly, other restrictive measures established by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in the U.S. Department of Commerce under the U.S. embargo against Cuba are maintained, imposing prohibitions and regulatory and licensing requirements on the import, export and re-export of goods and technology of U.S. origin to the island. The intensification of these regulatory and licensing requirements has a significant impact on procurements by the United Nations system, complicating and delaying procurement processes and severely restricting the use of the goods and technology procured by end-users. In general terms, procurement processes are also hampered by the increasing time spent on needs analysis, market research and the arrival of goods and services in the country; the significant reduction in the number of interested suppliers who are able to make an offer; the shortage of and difficult access to raw materials for the procurement and provision of services at the local level; and the increase in delivery times, costs associated with freight and insurance, as well as guarantees and maintenance.\n\n\nIn order to implement the BOS, the OMT agrees that main internal factors to ensure success are: full support from UNCT; keeping monthly meetings and reporting to UNCT on advancements, issues, and bottlenecks; strong internal control system from UN entities to allow process sharing; and that outcomes and recommendations from reviews are implemented by UN entities.\n\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the BOS only reflects common services and does not replace any UN entity\u2019s individual operational plan. As a living strategy, the BOS is rather elastic and flexible to adjust operational requirements as deemed necessary in the path to sustainable development. \n\n\n "},"participatingEntitites":[{"organizationId":18,"participating":true},{"organizationId":19,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2,"participating":true},{"organizationId":21,"participating":true},{"organizationId":22,"participating":true},{"organizationId":24,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2485,"participating":true},{"organizationId":25,"participating":true},{"organizationId":28,"participating":true},{"organizationId":29,"participating":true},{"organizationId":30,"participating":true},{"organizationId":31,"participating":true},{"organizationId":32,"participating":true},{"organizationId":33,"participating":true},{"organizationId":34,"participating":true},{"organizationId":35,"participating":true},{"organizationId":39,"participating":true},{"organizationId":40,"participating":true},{"organizationId":5,"participating":true},{"organizationId":50,"participating":true},{"organizationId":6,"participating":true},{"organizationId":8,"participating":true},{"organizationId":9,"participating":true}],"planRisks":[{"type":"risk","description":"Context: COVID-19 impacts costs of operations, programme delivery and staff wellbeing.","comment":null,"likelihood":"Highly Possible","impact":"Significant Concern","risktreatment":"Transfer","mitigationMeasure":"Work collaboratively, creating partnerships within the UN System in order to save costs and speed up the programme implementation."},{"type":"risk","description":"Context: Failure in local systems (Etecsa internet and banking) limiting operational continuity.","comment":null,"likelihood":"Possible","impact":"Significant Concern","risktreatment":"Accept","mitigationMeasure":"Monitor closely, strengthening the partnership and to look for new opportunities."},{"type":"risk","description":"Context: Fuel scarcity crises may directly impact continuity of operations.","comment":null,"likelihood":"Possible","impact":"Slight Concern","risktreatment":"Accept","mitigationMeasure":"Improve the planning of the logistics."},{"type":"risk","description":"Context: Inflation and foreign currency impact as part of the economic crisis.","comment":null,"likelihood":"Highly Possible","impact":"Significant Concern","risktreatment":"Transfer","mitigationMeasure":"Monitor the risk and adapt to the new context."},{"type":"risk","description":"Context: Natural disasters which affect programme delivery and continuity of operations.","comment":null,"likelihood":"Possible","impact":"Slight Concern","risktreatment":"Transfer","mitigationMeasure":"A Task Force is in place to monitor, advise and communicate."},{"type":"risk","description":"Context: Reforms and economic crisis limits operations and increases costs.","comment":null,"likelihood":"Highly Possible","impact":"Significant Concern","risktreatment":"Transfer","mitigationMeasure":"To improve the planning as well as the budgetary process.

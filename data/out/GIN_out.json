The BOS is implemented and operationalized through six (6) OMT Working Groups (Human Resources; Finance; Procurement; Administration; ICT; Logistics) to support shared planning, monitoring, and reporting for results under the direction of the OMT The BOS aims to improve the UNCT's assistance for program delivery and business operations in terms of cost effectiveness, quality, and efficiency.\n\nThe UNCT is made up of 23 members from UN agencies, funds, and programs, both resident and non-resident. These are:\n\nResident agencies: FAO, UNESCO, IOM, UN-RCS, UNAIDS, IFAD, UNCDF, UNESCO, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNIDO, UNOPS, WFP, ITC, UNHCR, OHCHR, UN Habitat, UNDSS, and WHO.\n\nNon-resident agencies: UNWOMEN, UNODC, ILO, and UNEP.\n\nIFIs: World Bank and International Monetary Fund\n\nThroughout the development of BOS 2.0, the Operations Management Team (OMT) and its technical Working Groups across the various UN Organizations had consultations to improve the performance of their systems.\n\nThe estimated cost savings for the 5-year period has been revised down to consider only local collaborations and remove all HQ arrangement of services provided to agencies as well as to consider utilized services where agencies are really engaged to collaborate. Therefore, following the 2022 annual review process, the estimated cost benefit was $ 5,782,366 while the realized reported is $ 3 167 419.\n\nOverall, the focus of the 2022 BOS review was not just on examining and evaluating the services, but also on drafting a more precise implementation plan with more definite deadlines. Meanwhile, to facilitate follow-up, lead agencies and responsible persons for operations under each service are updated.\n\nDuring the 2022 review, working groups decided as \u201cdo not include\u201d for ten (10 services) while they have added eleven (11) new common services from different service lines and service categories. Among the new services there are several highly recommended services:  \n\n1) Air Charter Services,\n2)      Green IT,\n3)      Knowledge Sharing,\n4)      Micro Assessment Database,\n5)      Mapping of talents and disability,\n6)      Staff training on disability,\n7)      Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA),\n8)      Integrated web-based Roster for consultants,\n9)      Cash disbursement and transfer\n10)   Green Solar energy.\n11) Graphic Design\n\nIn terms of gender, the UNCT gender group assessed the UNCT-SWAP gender equality scorecard with the help of UN Women and issued a report with critical recommendations. Gender approaches in procurement processes for women-owned firms should be considered by OMT.

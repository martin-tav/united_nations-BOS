[{"iso":"LBN","kickoff":{"startDate":"2024-01-01","endDate":"2024-03-31","description":" I am pleased to present the revised UN Country Team\u2019s Business Operations Strategy for the  period 2020 \u2013 2023. This Business Operations Strategy translates the UN Country Team priorities in the areas of common operations for 2020 \u2013 2023 into innovative activities. By adopting this Strategic Operations Framework, the UN Country Team in Lebanon confirms its commitment to managing their support to program delivery more efficiently, avoiding duplication of work and getting the best value for money.\n\nThis Business Operations Strategy builds on ongoing efforts by the UN Country Team to harmonize and simplify its business operations. In its development, the BOS 2.0 reflects 6 common areas: admin, ICT, procurement, HR, finance and logistics;  and ensures cooperation in 42 common services the majority of which will be scaled up moving forward.\n\nThe aim of this Business Operations Strategy is to further improve the quality, timeliness, and cost-effectiveness of our operations resulting in cost avoidance since working as ONE allows for joining of resources. This cost avoidance is different to savings as it is not reflected in terms of financial gains in budget but rather leads to less recurrent and labor costs.  It is estimated that as a result of its full implementation over its four year cycle, cost avoidance of over $3.6 million will be achieved as net benefits through efficiency gains in material & service procurement, labor costs, as well as from expense savings. The realized benefit is $1.6 million for the period of 2020-2021. It is worth mentioning that the majority of the avoidance is a result of common admin and ICT services particularly travel, and internet.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the managing agency  of each common service to achieve the yearly planned targets at the implementation level in close coordination and collaboration of the designated working group.  It is the responsibility of the OMT to monitor the implementation plan as endorsed by UNCT.  \n\nBy adopting the Strategic Operations Framework, the UN Country Team is marking its commitment to the simplification and harmonization of the UN\u2019s business operations and the achievement of better development results in Lebanon. Furthermore the UNCT in Lebanon considers this Business Operations Strategy an important step towards common back office for Lebanon commissioned  by the Secretary General.\n\nWe in the UN Country Team are happy to join the group of UN Country Teams who have already adopted the BOS framework in support of the UN reform, and we aim at improving further the lives of people in Lebanon."},"participatingEntitites":[{"organizationId":11,"participating":true},{"organizationId":1277,"participating":true},{"organizationId":17,"participating":true},{"organizationId":18,"participating":true},{"organizationId":19,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2,"participating":true},{"organizationId":21,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2485,"participating":true},{"organizationId":25,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2544,"participating":true},{"organizationId":28,"participating":true},{"organizationId":29,"participating":true},{"organizationId":30,"participating":true},{"organizationId":31,"participating":true},{"organizationId":31166,"participating":true},{"organizationId":32,"participating":true},{"organizationId":33,"participating":true},{"organizationId":34,"participating":true},{"organizationId":35,"participating":true},{"organizationId":36,"participating":true},{"organizationId":37,"participating":true},{"organizationId":39,"participating":true},{"organizationId":40,"participating":true},{"organizationId":47,"participating":true},{"organizationId":50,"participating":true},{"organizationId":53,"participating":true},{"organizationId":6,"participating":true},{"organizationId":8,"participating":true}],"planRisks":[{"type":"risk","description":"Interruption of services due to external factors related to security and access.

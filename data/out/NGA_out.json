[{"iso":"NGA","kickoff":{"startDate":"2024-01-01","endDate":"2024-03-31","description":"The United Nations Sustainable Development Partnership Framework (UNSDPF) 2018 - 2022, signed on 27 July 2017, between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the United Nations System, is a strategic common programmatic framework intended to serve as a collective offer to catalytic initiatives to drive the national development priorities of Nigeria. Twenty-one UN agencies committed to work together in pursuit of the strategic priorities laid out in the UNSDCF 2018-2022 towards achieving the National Development Strategy and the SDGs in Nigeria. As a critical strategy in achieving the effective implementation of the UNSDPF and in line with the UN efficiency reforms, the UNCT developed a Business Operations Strategy (BOS) to enhance cost savings and harness operational effectiveness for participating agencies for the purpose of accelerating progress towards the attainment of SDGs as savings from the BOS will serve as additional funds for programmes.  The agencies participating in BOS are FAO, IFAD, ILO, IOM, UN, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNIDO, UNOPS, UNDSS, UNOCHA, UN HABITAT, UNODC, UN WOMEN, WFP, WHO, WMO.\n\nThe Operations Management Team (OMT), made up of key operations technical staff from resident agencies and with support from UN Common Services and the RCO, lead the implementation of the efficiency agenda for effective delivery of the UNSDPF through the implementation of the signed Business Operation Strategy (BOS), implementation of the Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfers (HACT) and lead the planned move from Common Premises to UN House in Abuja. The OMT, under the guidance of the UNCT, deepened the excellent UN House experience, focusing on measurable efficiency that translated to actual cost-savings for the UN system, partners, and government. The OMT has in its priority to leverage the common premises experience in selected states where the model is programmatically desirable and financially feasible during the UNSDPF cycle.\n\nThe UNCT has formulated the BoS (2018-2022) alongside the UNSDPF and has identified five common areas for business operations harmonization in: Procurement, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), Human Resources, Finance &Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfer (HACT) and Administration (which includes travel\/Daily Subsistence Allowance harmonization and Common Premises). These areas can collectively reduce material, time, and labour costs during the UNSDPF implementation cycle. By identifying potential \u201cefficiency spaces\u201d across UN common operations, the BoS will provide the missing link between Operations and Programme aspects to functionally and systematically deliver the key outcomes in the UNSDPF through innovative and efficient common processes. The Business Operation Strategy (BOS), being core part of the UNSDPF, has received technical attention and support from the RCO to the OMT to ensure that it is rolled and UNSDPF Implemented.\n\nHaving implemented the Business Operations Strategy (BOS) for in the five year period in Nigeria, agencies, funds and programmes, have seen some successes in collaborative activities with service quality improvements, and efficiencies. The 2022review has highlighted specific financial savings and quality harnessed in the implementation of the BOS.\n\nThe reviewed BOS projected a cost avoidance estimated at USD 7,170,426 for the period 2019 \u2013 2023 while the realized cost benefit is USD 3,397,243 for the period 2019-2022. The realized cost benefit represents 47.4% of the estimated cost avoidance.\n\nThis projection comes amidst socio-political and economic conditions being experienced in the country including high inflation, currency devaluation and general economic recovery in the post COVID-19 period. With foresight, the Procurement Network and agencies\u2019 supply chain management colleagues expanded the vendor base and established Long Term Agreements (LTAs) across various frequently used services that locked in prices with suppliers. These actions have mitigated in some measure against fluctuating prices.\n\nThis review revealed that Nigeria is implementing fourteen (14) out of the fifty-two (52) High Impact Common services (HICs). These HICs include (i) Management of common services, (ii) staff counselling services, (iii) UN activities (UN cares & UN Day), (iv) Banking service and bank charges, (v) HACT Audit, (vi) HACT management, (vii) Micro-assessment Database, (viii) Gender Responsive Procurement Sourcing, (ix) Mobile phone services including scratch cards, (x) printing services, (xi) Management of common premises, (xii) security services (outsourced), (xiii) Travel services, and (xiv) carpooling It is hoped that more agencies would adopt these HICs and additional suitable HICs would be adopted for implementation in Nigeria.\n\nThe review highlighted the need to adopt accessibility measures of UN common premises to facilitate the implementation of the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy and use of solar energy to augment the electricity supply in the UN House in Abuja. These services were under development at various stages at the time of this review but were not sufficiently defined to be included in the BOS at this time. \n\nThe UNCT thanks the various network groups and the OMT for their diligence in conducting this review and looks forward to achieving programmatic and operational objectives through this cooperation of agencies.\n\nMatthias Schmale\nUN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator a.i.

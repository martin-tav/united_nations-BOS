The BOS focuses primarily on efficiency gains and cost avoidance through joint collaboration. It aims to enhance internal transaction cost avoidance and to improve the quality of services, including cost savings on externally sourced goods and services. The BOS is based on the existing corporate guidance, lessons learnt from the prior BOS and the needs emerging from the country partnership framework.\n\nIn this context, following a thorough review and analysis, aiming to identify solutions to existing bottlenecks in the UN operations, current BOS enunciates opportunities and cost benefits that have been identified in the common operationalization of the following five key service lines of business operations: Human Resources, Administration and common premises management, Finance, ICT and Procurement.\n\nCurrently, Moldova is facing the impact of the war in Ukraine and the continuation of the Refugees Situation following. To support the country in the crisis response, two new Agencies joined the UNCT, UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and World Food Programme (WFP) bringing their specialized knowledge and support. In this respect, LTAs currently established through OMT have been very instrumental to provide a rapid and cost-effective response.\n\nFollowing BOS Annual Review, OMT has identified opportunities of collaboration in additional number of 5 common services, totaling 37 Common services under 5 Service lines. Additional opportunities identified are in the area of Common Premises management, Gender and Disability Inclusion, Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA), recruitment. The BOS annual review process provided also the opportunity to re-assess the currently existing common services. To be mentioned, that one additional UN Agency, and namely WFP and UNHCR, has joined the OMT, bringing experience and knowledge.\n\nBOS has a strong focus on cost effectiveness and improved quality of services across the UN agencies and expected cost avoidance 2019-2025 constitute USD 1,033,153 for the period 2019-2025.\n\nThe OMT provides leadership on the implementation of a coordinated, efficient and effective common operational support agenda at the country level. It provides recommendations to the UNCT on common services and business-related issues and identifies opportunities for collaboration and innovation."},"participatingEntitites":[{"organizationId":11,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2,"participating":true},{"organizationId":21,"participating":true},{"organizationId":22,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2485,"participating":true},{"organizationId":25,"participating":true},{"organizationId":30,"participating":true},{"organizationId":31,"participating":true},{"organizationId":32,"participating":true},{"organizationId":34,"participating":true},{"organizationId":39,"participating":true},{"organizationId":40,"participating":true},{"organizationId":6,"participating":true},{"organizationId":8,"participating":true}],"planRisks":[{"type":"risk","description":"Business

[{"iso":"SLE","kickoff":{"startDate":"2024-01-01","endDate":"2024-03-31","description":"The United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Sierra Leone implemented the Business Operation Strategy in 2021 with the overall aim of achieving greater impact by being coherent and effective in delivering development results and humanitarian support, while harmonizing business practices across agencies for increased efficiency.\n\nThe BOS focused primarily on efficiency gains and cost avoidance while simultaneously improving quality of services, including cost savings on externally sourced goods and services and eliminate duplication of efforts, leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN and maximizing economies of scale.\n\nThe strategy is to focus on common services that are implemented jointly or delivered by one UN entity on behalf of one or more other UN entities. Common services in the following areas are identified for collaboration: Administration, including common Facilities\/Premises; Human Resources; Information, Communications and Technology (ICT); Finance, and Procurement.\n\nThe UNCT is composed of 23 members, with 14 resident UN Agencies, funds, and programmes participating in the BOS, 7 non-resident agencies and 2 IFIs.\n\nResident Agencies: FAO, ILO, IOM, UN-RCS, UNAIDS, UNCDF, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNIDO, UNOPS, UNWOMEN, WFP and WHO.\nNon-resident: IAEA, ITC, UNHCR, UNCTAD, UNODC, UNESCO and UNEP\n\nIFIs: World Bank and IMF\n\nPrepared through a highly consultative process with inputs from various UN Organizations in Sierra Leone, BOS aims to support effective programme delivery, monitoring and evaluation and reporting on common operations. The Operations Management Team (OMT) and its technical Working Groups within the various UN Organizations launched consultations throughout the BOS 2.0 development process to optimize the performance of their key functional areas of operations. The BOS, therefore, underscores key priority areas arising from these discussions, which are strengthened by a detailed operational analysis. Short and medium-term strategic results were also identified, that will guide the monitoring and evaluation of operations in the above mentioned six (6) common services during the programme cycle of Sierra Leone\u2019s UNSDCF 2020-2023.\n\nDesigned to be a living document, the BOS was implemented and operationalized through six (6) OMT Working Groups (Human Resources; Finance; Procurement; Administration; ICT; Logistics), under the guidance of the OMT to support joint planning, monitoring and reporting for results. Activities planned under the BOS aim to improve cost effectiveness, quality, and efficiency of the UNCT\u2019s support to programme delivery and business operations.\n\nFollowing the BOS review, the total budget of the BOS collaboration has been revised from USD90,690 to USD211,691 over the five-year period with costs shared among participating agencies and funding on annual basis.\n\nAfter the annual review on the achieved benefits and the BOS review process, the expected cost avoidance to be achieved during the 5- year period has been revised from USD1,288,301 to USD1,231,322 out of which cost avoidance of USD127,775 was achieved in 2021. Quality improvement is at the center of the BOS collaboration and this has been emphasized by the UNCT.\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in 2020, the UNCT in Sierra Leone has given strong support to UN cares activities. As a response, the UNCT approved an Isolation Center for positive patients of COVID-19 of UN personnel and their dependents. Additionally, UNCT engaged a Stress Counsellor for the benefit of UN personnel and their dependents whilst the UN Clinic in Sierra Leone provide COVID-19 vaccination services to UN personnel and dependents. These activities are part of the medical services and dispensary common service.\n\nOverall, during the 2022 BOS review, considerable focus was put on not only reviewing and assessing the services, but also developing a more detailed implementation plan with more specific timelines. Meanwhile, lead agencies and responsible persons for activities under each service were reviewed and updated.  \n\nGender responsiveness remains a high priority for the BOS. The OMT, with the support of UN Women and in line with the UNCT-SWAP gender equality scorecard\u2019s recommendations, had introduced into the BOS four gender-related KPIs: Three in HR common Services (gender parity, women retained on the HR roster, gender trainings) and one in procurement (women-owned businesses on the vendor roster). Gender-Responsive Procurement Sourcing; and Gender Parity as new common services.\n\nThe UNCT members have committed to allocate financial and human resources for the achievement of BOS objectives and make active use of the mutual recognition as a veritable driver of the collaboration."},"participatingEntitites":[{"organizationId":2,"participating":true},{"organizationId":21,"participating":true},{"organizationId":22,"participating":true},{"organizationId":23,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2485,"participating":true},{"organizationId":25,"participating":true},{"organizationId":30,"participating":true},{"organizationId":32,"participating":true},{"organizationId":33,"participating":true},{"organizationId":35,"participating":true},{"organizationId":39,"participating":true},{"organizationId":40,"participating":true},{"organizationId":5,"participating":true},{"organizationId":50,"participating":true},{"organizationId":6,"participating":true},{"organizationId":8,"participating":true}],"planRisks":[{"type":"risk","description":"Some

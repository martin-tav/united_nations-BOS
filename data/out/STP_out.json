[{"iso":"STP","kickoff":{"startDate":"2024-01-01","endDate":"2024-03-31","description":"The UNCT in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe consists of 6 physically present UN Agencies and the office of the UN Resident Coordinator (RCO): UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, WHO, FAO and WFP. The non-physically present representatives of agencies, funds and programmes signatories of the UNSDCF 2023-2027 are (ILO, UNHABITAT, OHCHR, UNESCO, UNODC, UNHCR, UNOHCHR, IFAD, UNEP, WMO, UN Women and ECA whose work encompasses development cooperation, humanitarian assistance. While each agency has programs and projects in accordance with its respective mandates, the United Nations Team is committed to ensuring that these programmes reinforce each other and provide optimal assistance to the country. The UNCT also maintains close cooperation with the WB, AfDB also signatories of the UNSDCF and IMF.\n\nThe UN S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe Business Operations Strategy (BOS) 2020-2025 is a medium-term strategic plan that focuses on Operations Management Team (OMT) support services to the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe United Nations Cooperation Framework for Sustainable Development 2023-2027 which is the primary instrument for the planning and implementation of sustainable development activities of all UN entities operating in Sao Tome and Principe towards the achievement of the 2030 Agenda.\n\nThe aim of the common business operations at country level is to ensure programme delivery is supported in an effective and efficient way, ensuring lower cost of operations, improving quality, timely operational support to participating agencies. The means to achieve this is through coordinated efforts in the area of business operations and in the case of a Business Operations Strategy (BOS), a joint, common approach for a selected range of operational support services where there is a clear business case to provide (common) services as a group of agencies, rather than providing these services as individual agencies. This could lead to a clear, demonstrable benefit in terms of cost reduction and\/or improved quality of services, realized by engaging jointly in the development and management of the identified common services, through Business Operations Strategy.\n\nSix UN entities and the UN Resident Coordinator Office engaged in this BOS which involves 33 common services across all common service lines. The collective results expected from this BOS will support the implementation of the UNSDCF and help the people of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe to live healthier, longer and more dignified, prosperous and secure lives.\n\nUnder supervision of the UN Country (UNCT), the Operations Management Team (OMT) provides leadership on the implementation of efficiency initiative on common business operations in a coordinated, efficient and effective manner at the country level.\n\nEric Jan Overvest, the UN Resident Coordinator is accountable to the Secretary-General for the development, implementation, monitoring and reporting of the BOS 2.0 and on steps towards development and implementation of a Common Back Office (CBO). The UNCT provides overall oversight of the BOS 2.0 process, approval and release of necessary UN Organizations and joint resources, sign off the final BOS 2.0 and annual reporting. The Operations Management Team (chaired by UNDP Operations Manager and its subsidiary bodies are responsible to facilitate development and implementation of the BOS at the country level.\n\nBased on the assessment, a law rate of implementation was recorded as few activities were implemented and most of activities  were reported to 2023 to ensure the efficiency gains and enable cost-avoidance. It is also expect that with implementation of planned activities in 2023, the UNCT will be able to have considerable quality improvement of the received services and goods, uniformly reflected for all agencies and ensuring good value for money. While the overall impact will be the composite result of avoided costs, including staff time, and higher quality.

[{"iso":"MOZ","kickoff":{"startDate":"2024-01-01","endDate":"2024-03-31","description":"This year marks the beginning of the new Mozambique United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF 2022-2026) which articulates the strategic engagement of the UNCT in Mozambique to support the country to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the national priorities. The UN RCO and twenty-five (25) UN agencies committed to work together in pursuit of the strategic priorities laid out in the UNSDCF 2022 \u2013 2026 towards achieving the SDGs in Mozambique. Seven Agencies are non-resident and thus not participating in BOS and these are: ECA, ITC, OHCHR, UNCDF, UNCTAD, UNEP, and UNV. The UN resident agencies including UN RCO and participating in BOS are FAO, IFAD, ILO, IOM, OCHA, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHABITAT, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNIDO, UNODC, UNOPS, UN WOMEN, WFP and WHO.\n\nSpearhead by the Resident Coordinator, facilitated and implemented by OMT and sustained by UNCT leadership and engagement, the Mozambique Business Operations Strategy (BOS) 2021\u20132025 is a results-based framework focusing on joint business operations with the purpose of eliminating duplication, leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN and maximizing economies of scale.\n\nDeveloped in 2021 as part of the BOS 2.0 exercise, the BOS expects to improve quality of services, including cost savings on externally sourced goods and services. Indeed, it aims at coordinating and aligning its activities for more efficient and effective service delivery, including the COVID-19 response, targeting the expected corporate results in cost and quality parameters, supporting DaO approach to operations and added value from business operations to UN Mandates. It supports maximizing the United Nation System collective advantage in addressing the humanitarian-development-peace nexus and aligning itself to the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe 2022 annual review indicated that UNCT Mozambique has achieved cost avoidance of USD 3.8 million (USD 0.44 in 2019 and USD 0.35 in 2020, USD 1.40 million in 2021 and USD 1.61 in 2022). The estimated cost avoidance up to the year 2027 has reached on this year\u2019s review to USD 45.0 million (against the original estimate of USD 7.6 million). The highest projection of estimate is under ICT equipment (USD 36 million). The top 10 services with the highest estimate cost avoidance are the below in order of rank.\n\n1) Mobile phone services including scratch cards.\n2) Joint Procurement services\n3) Management of common premises\n4) Travel services\n5) Vehicle rental\n6) Internet connectivity and VSAT services\n7) Construction related materials and services\n8) Harmonized customs clearance (outsourced)\n9) Conference and event management\n10) Help desk (first line support services).\n\nOverall, during the review, considerable emphasis was put not only on reviewing and assessing the services, but also developing a more detailed implementation plan with more specific timelines. The 2022 Annual Review allowed an addition of 12 new common services, including some of SDG impact (gender and disability inclusion).\n\nThe UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator (RC\/HC) led the overall BOS review process; the UNCT provided the oversight and approval and provided the necessary staff members to participate in the exercise; the Operations Management Team, co-chaired by UNDP Resident Representative and IOM Chief of Mission, and the OMT Working Groups were responsible to facilitate the collection of the data, the analysis and updating the implementation plan."},"participatingEntitites":[{"organizationId":11,"participating":true},{"organizationId":1277,"participating":true},{"organizationId":14,"participating":true},{"organizationId":18,"participating":true},{"organizationId":19,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2,"participating":true},{"organizationId":21,"participating":true},{"organizationId":22,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2275,"participating":true},{"organizationId":23,"participating":true},{"organizationId":24,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2485,"participating":true},{"organizationId":25,"participating":true},{"organizationId":28,"participating":true},{"organizationId":29,"participating":true},{"organizationId":30,"participating":true},{"organizationId":31,"participating":true},{"organizationId":32,"participating":true},{"organizationId":33,"participating":true},{"organizationId":34,"participating":true},{"organizationId":35,"participating":true},{"organizationId":37,"participating":true},{"organizationId":39,"participating":true},{"organizationId":40,"participating":true},{"organizationId":42,"participating":true},{"organizationId":5,"participating":true},{"organizationId":50,"participating":true},{"organizationId":6,"participating":true},{"organizationId":8,"participating":true},{"organizationId":9,"participating":true}],"planRisks":[{"type":"risk","description":"Agencies

[{"iso":"UGA","kickoff":{"startDate":"2024-01-01","endDate":"2024-03-31","description":"Consistent with the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) resolution requiring the UN to explore ways to enhance cooperation, collaboration and coordination while employing the sense of urgency in streamlining its business processes with the hope to reduce transaction costs and demonstrate operational efficiency; and in accordance with global best practices, the UNCT, through its Operations Management Team (OMT), set out to develop this business strategy (BOS). The BOS is a results-based framework that focuses on joint business operations with the purpose of eliminating duplication, leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN and maximizing economies of scale.\n\nThe UNCT in Uganda, consisting of 29 UN entities and the UN RCO and those with physical presence in country as well as those who do not, developed BOS 2.0 in 2020 with the overall aim of achieving greater impact by being coherent and effective in delivering development results while harmonizing business practices across agencies for increased efficiency.\n\nThere are twenty-two (22) UN entities and the RCO with physical presence in country and seven (7) who are non-resident. Those with physical presence in Uganda are FAO, IFAD, ILO, IOM, OHCHR, UNAIDS, UNCDF, UNDP, UNDSS, UNESCO, UNFCCC, UNFPA, UN Habitat, UN RCO, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNIDO, UNODC, UNOPS, UNV, UN Women, WFP and WHO. The Non-resident entities are IAEA, ITC, UNCTAD, UNDESA, UNDRR, UNECA, UNEP.\n\nThe BOS 2.0 in Uganda focuses on common services that are implemented jointly or delivered by one UN entity on behalf of one or more other UN entities. Common services in the following areas are identified for collaboration: Administration, including common Facilities\/Premises; Human Resources; Information, Communications and Technology (ICT); Finance, and Procurement. As for the logistical services, OMT in UN Uganda has a working group where collaboration among agencies is starting in 2022 to be reported in the next cycle of review.\n\nIn the BOS2.0 Review in 2022, revisions were made mainly in the following areas, resulting in the reduction of the overall cost savings from Uganda for 5 years.\n\n- UN Uganda conducted the review with fresh eyes and detailed analysis of contractual status in a participatory manner on the volume of contracts and expenditures (both realized and projected). In the process, some of the errors in the previous submission were also rectified, including \u201clabor cost\u201d where several agencies previously reported \u201cexpenditures\u201d instead of \u201cnumber of purchase orders\u201d.\n- UN Uganda, through a fully inclusive approach, had scrutinized areas where real collaborations are taking place to generate actual savings.\n\nThrough the process, it has clearly emerged that \u201cLTA for Fuel\u201d and \u201cInternet Connectivity and VSAT\u201d are the two major areas making the highest impact through collaborations, followed by \u201cTravel Services\u201d, \u201cConference and Event Management\u201d, and \u201cMobile Phone Services\u201d. \n\nThe total estimated cost avoidance of Uganda is revised from USD 21.1 million USD to USD 2.7 million during the BOS annual review. In 2021, the UNCT was able to realize USD 1.7 million of cost avoidance.\n\nThe submission reflects the areas of the collaboration as well as projected figures more clearly than the previous BOS. It is also noted that most collaborations were found to be among those UN entities who are resident in Uganda. The review process itself also further helped to deepen knowledge of system-wide collaboration among participating agencies. The enhanced understanding on the efficiencies gains as well as options available for mutual recognition identified from the review process in the areas of logistical services, are expected to bring about the positive future behavioral change among UNCT in exploring and expanding collaboration in coming years. The UN in Uganda is also committed to allocate available human and financial resources to the continued implementation of the BOS 2.0."},"participatingEntitites":[{"organizationId":11,"participating":true},{"organizationId":1277,"participating":true},{"organizationId":18,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2,"participating":true},{"organizationId":21,"participating":true},{"organizationId":22,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2275,"participating":true},{"organizationId":23,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2476,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2485,"participating":true},{"organizationId":25,"participating":true},{"organizationId":28,"participating":true},{"organizationId":29,"participating":true},{"organizationId":3,"participating":true},{"organizationId":30,"participating":true},{"organizationId":31,"participating":true},{"organizationId":32,"participating":true},{"organizationId":33,"participating":true},{"organizationId":34,"participating":true},{"organizationId":35,"participating":true},{"organizationId":37,"participating":true},{"organizationId":39,"participating":true},{"organizationId":40,"participating":true},{"organizationId":47,"participating":true},{"organizationId":5,"participating":true},{"organizationId":50,"participating":true},{"organizationId":6,"participating":true},{"organizationId":8,"participating":true},{"organizationId":9,"participating":true}],"planRisks":[{"type":"risk","description":"Delayed

Overall, the OMT has identified five focus areas for Operations as One and assigned experts from the respective agencies to participate in Working Groups responsible for these focus areas. These five areas are Procurement, Human Resources, Finance, Information and Communication Technology and One House.\n\nThe BOS was implemented and operationalised through five (5) OMT Working Groups (Human Resources; Finance; Procurement; Administration; and ICT) under the guidance of the OMT to support joint planning, monitoring, and reporting for results. Activities planned under the BOS aim to improve cost effectiveness, quality, and efficiency of the UNCT\u2019s support to programme delivery and business operations.\n\nEach UN Agency is leading each pillar under BOSII rotational basis. In collaboration with the participating agencies, each lead agency is responsible for the implementation of activities assigned under each post. The following resident UN agencies participate in the Rwanda BOS \u2013 UN Women, UNHCR, WFP, WHO, FAO, IOM, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNECA and UN-Habitat. \n\nThe United Nations system in Rwanda consists of 22 UN agencies, programmes, and funds, both 14 residents and 8 non-residents. Meantime for any non \u2013 resident UN agencies, projects\/ programmes in the country and supported by UNDP, their CBA data and quality KPI data were captured by UNDP as an administrative agency\/ service provider. UNDP continues to provide support payments to enable them to function in Rwanda for UNCDF, IFAD, UNDSS, UN Clinic, OHCHR, UN-HABITAT and UNV. The new Resident Coordinator is Mr Ozonnia Ojielo, the OMT chair is housed within UNDP.\n\nThe UNCT in Rwanda aims to save approximately US$ 4,126,691 over the UNSDCF cycle from July 2019 to June 2025 in efficiency gains and monetary savings. In 2022, the Rwanda cost avoidance for all categories generated by BOS II was US$ 1,602,295.\n\nThe UNCT members have committed to allocating financial and human resources to achieve BOS objectives and actively use mutual recognition as a veritable driver of the collaboration.  \n\nCommon Service | Amount\nAdministration | 1,032,537\nFinance | 127,483\nHuman Resource | 51,255\nLogistic | 45,279\nProcurement | 345,741 \nTotal | 1,602,295$\nEND"},"participatingEntitites":[{"organizationId":14,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2,"participating":true},{"organizationId":21,"participating":true},{"organizationId":22,"participating":true},{"organizationId":2485,"participating":true},{"organizationId":25,"participating":true},{"organizationId":30,"participating":true},{"organizationId":31,"participating":true},{"organizationId":32,"participating":true},{"organizationId":39,"participating":true},{"organizationId":40,"participating":true},{"organizationId":8,"participating":true}],"planRisks":[{"type":"risk","description":"- UN Agencies not willing to participate and share related information","comment":null,"likelihood":"Negligible","impact":"Minimal","risktreatment":"Accept","mitigationMeasure":"- Ensure mechanisms exist to incorporate the participation of all UN agencies in Rwanda."},{"type":"risk","description":"New banking tender in year 3 may results in bank fees & remuneration of current account depend on pricing","comment":null,"likelihood":"Negligible","impact":"Minimal","risktreatment":"Accept","mitigationMeasure":"To ensure all UN agencies participate in the tender in year3"},{"type":"risk","description":"Savings calculated based on UN rate which is sometime close to the market rate.","comment":null,"likelihood":"Remote","impact":"Minimal","risktreatment":"Accept","mitigationMeasure":"To ensure all UN agencies participate whilst negotiating these rates with the commercial banks.

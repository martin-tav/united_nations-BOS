AFG;Afghanistan;229;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Business Operations Strategy (BOS) Afghanistan:

Since the adoption of the UN Secretary General’s reform agenda, the United Nations Country Team in Afghanistan has sought to continually build on the comparative advantage of all UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes to tackle the development and humanitarian challenges in country. Until 15 August 2021, the One UN Framework for Afghanistan steered the UN Country Team on enhancing the UN’s contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals, under the guidance of an empowered and impartial Resident Coordinator. The August 2021 power shift in Afghanistan has created the need for a transitional strategy for the UN to address the deepening political and social-economic instability. Afghanistan is still confronting an unprecedented humanitarian crisis with a very real risk of systemic collapse and human catastrophe that threatens to cancel many of the development gains of the last twenty years. To this end, the UN and its partners had developed the one-year Transitional Engagement Framework (TEF) as overarching strategic planning document for the UN system’s assistance for 2022 which has been extended to June 2023. It provides strategic direction and coherence; ensures UN coordination, collaboration, and complementarity of action; and provides a basis for joint risk-sharing and accountability. Looking ahead, the UN in Afghanistan with its partners is currently developing a medium-term strategy for 2023-2025, building on the TEF to continue advancing recovery and resilience in Afghanistan. The new framework developed jointly with development partners will provide strategic direction and coherence; ensure coordination, collaboration, and complementarity between humanitarian, development, and peace approaches of the international community; and provide a basis for joint risk-sharing and accountability for interventions on basic human needs and rights. This framework, the review of the Common Country Analysis (CCA) as well as the Business Operations Strategy (BOS) are opportunities to guide and focus the work of the UN Country Team to promote more effective and efficient programme delivery on the 2030 Agenda. Additionally, BOS is an integral part of the UN reform scorecard and essential for effective resource mobilization from 2023 and onwards.

Recognizing the importance of the harmonized approach, the United Nations in Afghanistan initiated their collective work and inter-agency collaboration on formulation of a results-based framework “Business Operations Strategy (BOS)” in September 2020.  The objective of this effort to have UN joint business operations with the purpose of eliminating duplication, leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN and maximizing economies of scale as well as reducing transaction cost.  It is facilitated by the principles of mutual recognition, client satisfaction and costing and pricing.

After continued efforts and collaboration of OMT with the support and guidance from Resident Coordinator (RC) and UN Country Team, the Business Operations Strategy (BOS) was finalized on 15 December 2020. As per newly established guideline, the realized efficiencies for the prior years were adjusted by each of the agencies accordingly.

The cost avoidance for the year 2022 is USD 269,696 and the combined realized efficiencies for years 2020, 2021 and 2022 is now USD 14 million as the UNCT continue to implement the One UN Framework approach from 2021-2025 (now TEF and starting mid-2023 a different strategic framework).

The BOS 2.0 focuses primarily on quality and efficiency gains. It will reduce internal transaction costs and provide significant cost avoidance on externally sourced goods and services. 

After the BOS annual review and under the current Afghanistan country context, the projected cost avoidance and efficiency gains for the year 2020 – 2027 is USD 31.8 million as illustrated in the summary table below and as presented in more detail breakdown by agency – Annex 1 below:

 

During the review process, additional services have been identified which will contribute to efficiency gains and will be incorporated in the next annual review to bring further quality improvements.  These activities will target environmental sustainability, disability and inclusion, gender responsive budgeting and youth engagements.

Proposed BOS implementation activities will be funded through the OMT budget. Funds will be officially requested to the UN organisations, Agencies, Funds, and Programmes comprising the UNCT in Afghanistan. The BOS review is an annual process for the OMT/UNCT to have a better sense of the realized achievements in support of the SG’s Efficiency agenda."
AGO;Angola;305;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"BOS 2.0 in Angola was framed around the Secretary General’s strategy to enable the United Nations Development System to be more effective for better supporting the implementation of the new UNSDCF 2020-2022 and the achievement of the 2030 Agenda.

The United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Angola developed the Business Operations Strategy (BOS) 2.0 to coordinate and align its activities for more efficient and effective service delivery, including COVID-19 response, thereby mitigating duplications of processes, restrain transaction costs and enhance operational efficiency. As part of the UNSDCF, BOS 2.0 is aimed at ensuring the United Nation System’s collective advantage in addressing the humanitarian-development-peace nexus and aligning itself to the Sustainable Development Objectives.

The Business Operations Strategy (BOS) is a results-based framework that focuses on joint business operations with the purpose of eliminating duplication, leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN and maximizing economies of scale.

The BOS 2.0 was developed through the BOS online platform starting on February 2020 after one of the OMT members attended the BOS training of trainers in Addis Ababa, organized by UN DCO. Unfortunately, with the Covid-19 expansion, the UN offices in Angola were obliged to opt for teleworking as of 19 March 2020. Considering that not all the OMT members and BOS working groups members had uninterrupted internet access, the BOS development was hampered and suspended till the arrival of the new RC.

The BOS is focused on common services that are implemented jointly or delivered by one UN entity on behalf of one or more other UN entities. In Angola, the common services for future collaboration were identified in the areas of Administration, Finance, Human Resources, Information and Communications Technology (ICT), Logistics and Procurement.

The following UN Organizations participated in the BOS 2.0 in Angola: FAO, IOM, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP, WHO and UN RCO. Other entities such as the ADB, IMF and the World Bank contributed to the development of the document.

Zahira VIRANI, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator (RC/HC), who signed off the final BOS 2.0, led the overall process and she is accountable to the Secretary-General for the development, implementation, monitoring and reporting of the BOS 2.0 and further steps towards establishing a Local Shared Service Center in Angola.

The UNCT provided the oversight of the BOS 2.0 process, approval and release of necessary staff members and joint resources. 

The BOS 2.0 was prepared in a highly consultative process with the input of the above mentioned various UN Organizations in Angola, with the ultimate goal of supporting effective programme delivery, monitoring and evaluation and reporting on common operations.

The BOS 2.0, therefore, underlines key priority areas arising from these discussions strengthened by a detailed operational analysis and provides the short and medium-term strategic results that will guide the monitoring and evaluation of operations in above mentioned five (5) common services during the implementation of Angola’s UNSDCF 2020 – 2025.

The Inter-agency activities to be implemented in aforementioned areas will help to improve cost avoidance, quality, and efficiency of the UNCT’s support to programme delivery.

The BOS 2.0 in Angola is contributing to the following SDGs: eliminate Poverty (efficient joint process of common procurement, allowing the Agencies in Angola to take advantage of fast procurement of required goods or services, following the proper needs assessment, considerably contribute to the delivery of programme results on the poverty eradication); Good Health and Well-Being (social support rendered by the UN System in Angola through all the present Agencies facilitates the good health and well-being in the country with the help of the refined duty of care programmes with their long-term focus on families and their dependents); Gender Equality (the joint recruitment processes followed by the UN Agencies always have a gender quality indicator, and compliance is regularly monitored. Agency HR reports are published, with the accurate disaggregated data); Decent Work and Economic Growth (UN Agencies in Angola have high standards of work ethics and focus on quality; at the same time, staff welfare is one of the main goals throughout the Agencies, in order to ensure healthy work climate, flexible working arrangements and speak-up culture. A similar culture is cultivated within the UN partners environment).

UN Angola BOS is focusing on the following High-Impact Services: Benefits Management, Integrated Web-based Roster for Consultants, Mapping of Talents for Persons with Disability, Banking Services and Bank Charges, HACT services, Internet Connectivity and VSAT Services, Mobile Phone Services Including Scratch Cards, Printing Services, Management of Common Premises, Security Services.

UNICEF in Angola performed the first BOS review in Q2 2022. Overall, the review has demonstrated that the implementation period was too short for significant results. The process has also revealed the capacity gaps and the need to better mobilize joint resources towards reviewing open LTAs for the agreed services, securing additional support for administering the Common Premises and ICT Helpdesk, harmonizing HR and administration services.

In the course of the review, it was agreed to prioritize the implementation of a range of services, therefore the following services were shifted to 2022: HR - mapping of talents, ICT - helpdesk and Administration – disposal of assets. This has not brought a major change in overall BOS strategy as the volume of services has not changed – but the sequence of implementation was revised in order to better and faster ensure their delivery and quality assurance. 

Following the review, the projected cost avoidance has amounted to USD1,402,779 with the already realized benefit of USD 635,285.

The 2022 review has resulted in minor amendments of services that were no longer agreed to be included in BOS, due to capacity limitations and change of priorities, but pursued by the Agencies individually, if needed.

The UNSDCF of Angola has been extended until 2023 keeping the BOS concurrent with the present Programme Cycle.

ALB;Albania;303;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Despite the challenges posed by the triple shock of the earthquake of November 2019, the Covid-19 pandemic since 2020, and the start of the war in Ukraine in 2022, Albania has continued to show its commitment to European Union (EU)-oriented reforms and delivered tangible and sustainable results. The first Inter-governmental Conference in July 2022 marked the opening of accession negotiations with the EU. Albania is the only country in the region that has signed cooperation agreements with all justice and home affairs agencies of the EU. The third National Strategy for Development and European Integration (NSDEI) 2022–2030 has been prepared in consultations with all stakeholders, including the UN, and has the potential to strengthen the interface between the socio-economic and environmental targets and the overall governance reforms. Also, it will play an important role in implementation of the Government of Albania and United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 2022–2026. The government is well positioned to address the many challenges facing Albania and has included agriculture, energy, digitalization, tourism and fighting corruption among its priorities, with European integration as the guiding goal.

In terms of sustainable development, Albania’s real economic growth rebounded better than foreseen following the pandemic, and is projected to be around 3.2 percent for 2022. The country experienced a smooth vaccination rollout, with no further lockdowns and continued recovery in services, led by tourism, and construction. Good progress was made to refocus health services at the primary level, introduce digital health services and improve transparency and accountability. The 2022 Sustainable Development Report index score of 71.63 suggests that the country is more than two-thirds of the way towards achieving the SDGs, with a position of 61 out of 163 countries. The second Gender Equality Index was conducted in 2022 to measure gender inequalities across reproductive health, empowerment, and participation in the labour market. It shows that gender disparities have increased in the past year, with an increased value of 0.09 compared to 0.06 measured in 2021 (Men and Women in Albania, INSTAT 2022)

The Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework between the Government of Albania (GoA) and the United Nations (UN) system for the years 2022-2026 is anchored by the below strategic priorities:

Strategic Priority A - Human capital development and social inclusion.

Outcome - By 2026 there is increased and more equitable investment in people, removing barriers and creating opportunities for those at risk of exclusion.

Strategic Priority B - Sustainable, resilient and green economic growth and resource management.

Outcome - By 2026 innovative and integrated policy solutions accelerate sustainable, productive and inclusive economic development, enhancing climate change adaptation and mitigation and transition to a green and blue economy.

Strategic Priority C - Effective, people-centred governance, rule of law, human rights and gender equality.

Outcome 1 - By 2026, governance is more transparent and accountable, enabling people to enjoy quality, inclusive services, enhanced rule of law and access to justice in line with Albania’s human rights commitments.

Outcome 2 - By 2026, gender responsive governance strengthens equality and non-discrimination, promotes women’s empowerment and human rights, and reduces violence against women and children.

As a DaO country, Albania has been working to identify ways to ensure more coherent, efficient and effective operations at the country level. As early as 2005, Common Services was already implemented in Albania with the introduction of common security and medical services. These were further developed and expanded to other areas within the framework of Delivering as One.

The Business Operations Strategy has been a lively forum and platform for ongoing and productive cooperation amongst Operations Management Team (OMT) members and working groups, the UN RC Office and UNCT throughout 2022. The number of BOS participating agencies increased to 8 with the joining of UNOPS in several common services. Key priorities include completion of the 2022 Business Operations Strategy annual review and implementation of the Disability Inclusion initiative. The annual review process reinstated the good quality of common services provided, shown evidently by the good average scoring of key performance indicators by all participating agencies. Following the solid and long-standing experience in establishing the Long-term Agreements (LTAs), OMT worked jointly to finalise a few solicitation processes for several common services and by the end of the year, the UN agencies in Albania had benefited from ten renewed LTAs, bringing the total number to 21 for thirteen common service areas, achieving an estimated cost avoidance of USD 223,000 for a volume of expenditures for LTAs use of USD 3.2 million. UN agencies also benefited from common medical services and common premises services through renewal of two MoUs. Green IT initiatives were identified from the ICT working group focused on environmentally certified companies for ICT equipment disposal and improvement and simplification of electronic equipment disposal process. OMT scaled up its work in promoting disability inclusion in operations, with contribution to UN House physical accessibility assessment, establishment of a database for young talented individuals with disabilities, training of OMT members and the Procurement Working group on disability inclusion procurement and formulation of disability inclusion guidelines for the Procurement of Goods and Services by UN Agencies in Albania.

The annual review process reinstated the good quality of common services provided, shown evidently by the good average scoring of KPIs by all participating agencies.

2022 BOS analysis confirmed the benefits of close collaboration of UN Agencies in the common services, both in terms of the realized cost avoidance totaling approximately 227,00 USD, and quality achievement for the four applicable common service lines (Administration, HR, ICT and Finance)."
ARE;United Arab Emirates;393;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The UN Country Team in the UAE is pleased to join efforts in developing and implementing the first Business Operations Strategy for the UAE. This Business Operations Strategy translates UN Country Team priorities in the areas of common operations, to achieve greater cost-effectiveness and improve the quality of services provided to all Agencies present in the UAE. 

The UAE BOS covers the period from 01 January 2021 - 31 December 2023. It will build on existing services, harmonize the approach to service provision by individual Agencies, and reinforce the common use of systems available in all Agencies. 

The Stock Take represents the common services currently provided by WFP as a lead Agency, in the absence of UNDP. These services have been provided by WFP since 2019 on a cost recovery basis. The services will continue as is, unless there are changes in the status of participating Agencies, such as entering into a Host Agreement with the UAE Government.

In the context of the UAE, where Agencies have limited or no programmatic activities, the UAE BOS will concentrate on improving the quality of services in the areas of Administration, Finance, IT, and Procurement. It will also focus on outreach to organizations working with disabled communities and women, and promote environmental sustainability. The joint approach will also leverage and advance the image of One UN in the UAE.

The implementation of services will be carried out by existing staff and using tools already available, thus, we do not foresee need for additional financial resources. 

The BOS will be subject to review in February 2022. 

As per the 2021 review, the realized gains amount to USD 290,445 for 2 services, which are protocol and procurement of ICT and network hardware. Some of the activities, such as outreach to organizations working with disabled communities and women in procurement and recruitment that were planned for 2021 were not completed. However, the OMT with the support of the UNCT will continue working on establishing the relationship with those organisations and promote the collaboration. 

2022 Review:

The United Nations has a significant presence and cooperation in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Given the nature of the UAE relationship with the UN as both a donor and a programme country, there is no comprehensive framework guiding the UN’s work in a whole-of-system approach, and engagement of agencies is contingent upon working relationships with their respective thematic counterparts.

While some of these working relationships entail programmatic activities focused on strengthening UAE systems and institutions, most of the UN work focuses on operations as a major global logistics hub for delivery of humanitarian assistance. The UAE has been a key contributor to various UN humanitarian efforts, mainly through the International Humanitarian City in Dubai, where WFP, WHO, UNHCR and UNICEF maintain prepositioned stockpiles of humanitarian supplies for rapid dispatch. Another important function carried out agencies in the UAE is related to partnership-building/resource mobilization, both for public and private sectors. Additionally, some entities also operate a broader regional mandate, hosting their sub-regional (GCC) offices from the UAE.

As per 2022 review, the realized cost avoidance is USD 116,412. The cost avoidance is the result of cooperation of the Agencies in the Protocol Services.

The lack of the programmatic activities limits the possibilities for the collaboration, however, UNCT and OMT continue looking for new opportunities. "
ARG;Argentina;306;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"El Business Operations Strategy (BOS) es un marco basado en resultados que se centra en operaciones conjuntas con el propósito de eliminar la duplicación, mejorando el poder de negociación común de la ONU y la maximización de las economías de escala.
                                                
En consonancia con los objetivos de reforma de la ONU del Secretario General ha diseñado el BOS en apoyo de una ejecución más eficaz de la Agenda 2030. 

El BOS se enfoca en servicios comunes que se implementan de manera conjunta o entregados por una entidad de la ONU en nombre de una o más entidades de la ONU. 

En la revisión del BoS se contempla mantener las colaboraciones en las áreas de servicios de Administración, Adquisiciones, Finanzas y Recursos Humanos. 

Las siguientes agencias, fondos y programas de la ONU están participando del BOS en la República Argentina: CEPAL, CINU, OIT, OIM, OPS/OMS, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, ACNUR, UNOPS, UNICEF, UNWOMEN, FAO, UNDSS y OCR. 

En Argentina, el grupo de OMT ha determinado que el BOS será realizado por un período de 5 (Cinco) años - 2021 a 2025,  sin desconocer el contexto económico y social  particular de Argentina (Hiperinflación) donde planificar a largo plazo requiere de un seguimiento permanente y de evaluación.

El 13 de marzo de 2022 asume funciones la Coordinadora Residente de ONU Argentina, Sra. Claudia Mojica, y quien para 2023 nuevamente siguiendo sus responsabilidades hará el sign off del BoS 2.0

El UNCT proporciono supervisión general del BOS en el proceso, aprobación y liberación de la agencia necesaria y recursos conjuntos, la aprobación del BOS final y el informe anual. 

El Operations Management Team interagencial (OMT), presidido por Beatriz Satizabal, Head of Support Services de UNOPS para Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay y Brasil; conjuntamente con Eugenia Quintana como Co-Chair de OMT, Funcionaria Principal de Operaciones de OIT; y sus órganos subsidiarios facilitaron  el desarrollo e implementación del BOS  a nivel de país durante el 2022 y lideraron el proceso de revision del BoS 2.0, que inicio en un retreat de un dia el 9 de Marzo de 2023

Se hizo un light review del BOS, con las siguientes salvedades

1. Se desagrego la ""agencia UN"" en cada una de las agencias que anteriormente se consolidaban UNS RCOs, UNS ECLAC, UNS DGC y UNS DGC.
2. Seguimos reportando en la categoría Travel , el LTA interagencial pero requerimos un mayor análisis, y replantear la categoría para el próximo año ya que consideramos que el ahorro no esta en el LTA si no en otras variables como volumen y Negociación con Proveedores.
3. La revisión del BOS se realizo y operativizo en un retreat de los OMT members y WG que realizamos por primera vez y fue una jornada muy productiva,

La  Presentación y aprobación del BoS se llevo a cabo en el UNCT del 28 de marzo, el UNCT solicito al OMT compartir  los desafíos actuales en la movilidad del BOS con el objetivo de escalarlo a sus sedes y garantizar la alineación de las agencias.
- Falta una definición clara de algunas agencias sobre su grado de involucramiento en este ejercicio
- Estimar los costos-beneficios se dificulta al haber diferencias en los criterios que se utilizan para determinar los costos de las operaciones por parte de las distintas agencias.
- Otro desafío son aquellas agencias con servicios centralizados en otros países, que hacen que la negociación a nivel local se vea perjudicada pero a la vez, resultan en mayores costos para esas agencias
-La implementación de varias de las iniciativas requieren de tiempo y esfuerzo de los funcionarios de las agencias, que no siempre pueden dedicarle el tiempo necesario.
- En un contexto de alta inflación como el actual y con una política cambiaria inestable, es muy difícil medir ahorros o negociar acuerdos, ya que los precios fluctúan diariamente y muchas veces están más determinados por los plazos de pagos de las agencias, o la flexibilidad para indexar contratos, que por el valor de los productos o servicios

En base al ejercicio realizado, se estima un ahorro de costos de USD 320,284 en maangement en Common Premises, de transport services USD 93,528 y Security services USD 159,015, lo que totaliza un ahorro USD 572,827."
ARM;Armenia;307;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The current Business Operations Strategy (BOS) for Armenia was signed on 9 April 2021 and is in effect until 31 December 2025. This BOS built upon the first Armenia BOS, which covered the period from 2017 to 2020. Therefore, some service lines in the current BOS have a start date of 2017 for implementation, but for most service lines the cost-benefit analysis reflects actual figures from 2019 onwards. This allows for the analysis of opportunity costs per agency for each long-term service agreement.

The cumulative cost-avoidance for 2019-22 was initially estimated to be about $2.5m, which was revised last year to $1.5m, but the actual cost-avoidance is slightly less, at around $1.25m. The estimated cost-avoidance for 2023 only is calculated at around $0.5m, which will bring the overall cost-avoidance for 5 years (2019-23) to around $2m.

During the last annual review, UNIDO joined the BOS framework, while UNS-RCO joined in mid-2022, bringing the total number of participating UN agencies to eleven. The agencies with limited activities in the country do not use the common framework, and having limited administrative capacity, they rely on UNDP for support.

This being a ""light"" review, no service lines were added or discontinued, but few agencies have chosen to withdraw from collaborating on certain service lines as they did not use those services."
AZE;Azerbaijan;398;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"This Business Operations Strategy has been developed at as pivotal time for Azerbaijan, which in 2021 has transitioned into a new five-year Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework with the UN (UNSDCF). As such, the BOS supports UN activities in Azerbaijan, ensuring that operations help bring together UN entities in and outside the country and leveraging on the cost benefit that results from common service delivery. It builds on some of the successes of the previous BOS covering the period July 2018- Dec 2020, particularly by continuing services where common delivery has been possible and by identifying areas were scaling up of activities can be performed. The transition to BOS 2.0 was delayed by a few months due to the escalation of hostilities in and around Nagorno Karabakh. However, agencies have been able to come together under the OMT to design a plan that reflects four outcome areas with efficiency gains both in monetary terms and in terms of technical knowledge: Procurement and Administration, Finance, Human Resources, and ICT.

The OMT conducted annual BOS reviewed in March 2022. The document was updated in terms of participating agencies list and members in the different working groups. The updated documents reflect the new members of UNCT who joined to the Team in 2021. RC and head UNICEF names are replaced with the new members, the UNDP RR name was deleted due to his move from the country and OMT Chair name was updated. Stock Take and Opportunity Analyses sections also updated as per actual situation and results of changes observed in the first year of implementation. Start date of several opportunities are moved to the next stages. In some cases (like, UNDP) a lot of services implemented in the Country Office level until 2021 moved to the Global Shared Service Centres (GSSC). There were also updates in the common premises management process and common-services issues. WHO moved out from the main UN House due to its expansion of the operations and increased number of the office staff. The agency was taken out from all premises management initiatives and service provisions. With the request from the HQ/regional office, UNOPS also was opt out from the BOS services. It was explained with the agency’s little presence in the country.

All these matters reviewed by the OMT and relevant changes made in the updated BOS document.

The UNCT total realized cost-avoidance benefit for 2022 is $ 91,216.   "
BDI;Burundi;318;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The UN System and the Government of Burundi signed on 3 December 2022, a new United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) for the period 2023-2027, fully aligned with the National Development Plan (NDP), for the period 2018-2027, which aims to engage the country in a crucial stage of its social and economic development.

Through this new Cooperation Framework, the UNS commits to work with the Government to achieve national development priorities and the MDGs.

 A total of 12 United Nations agencies, funds and programs present in the country (FAO, IFAD, UNHCR, IOM, WHO, UN WOMEN, UNAIDS, WFP, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF) signed the UNSDCF.

The 13 existing agencies will be joined by 9 new agencies to strengthen the Burundi UNS, ensuring coverage of important sectoral niches to meet specific needs in Burundi, and the exploitation of important synergies with existing capacities. The new agencies which signed the UNSDCF are: OHCDH, UNHABITAT, UNEP, ECA, ILO, UNIDO, UNCDF, UNOPS, UIT.

The BOS implementation is an important step for the United Nations System in Burundi in the implementation of Delivering as One (DaO), which aims at the coherence and harmonization of the United Nations Agencies’ interventions. It will also support the UNDCF’s implementation, focusing on common services that can be implemented or provided jointly and thus allow for cost sharing and cost avoidance.

The objective of the BOS is, to the extent possible, to harmonize the agencies' operational procedures to reduce transaction costs and improve services’ quality, in support to the UNSDCF implementation. This objective is in line with the UN Secretary-General's vision on UN reform, particularly regarding the new generation of UN Country Teams.

Burundi developed its BOS in 2018 and all the 12 UN Resident Agencies were involved. OMT decided to focus on 13 common services that could be subject of long-term agreements for the BOS 2019-2023, spread over 6 pillars.

In 2020, the overall savings projected by the BOS over the first five years were estimated at US$ 2,381,965 representing an annual saving of $476.393. Most of these savings were projected mainly from cost avoidance with administration service.

With the first annual review of BOS in 2021, the total savings for the 12 agencies implementing BOS at the country level were evaluated at USD 775,473.

With the 2022 annual review, the total savings are estimated at USD 803,060."
BEN;Benin;312;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"La présente stratégie représente la deuxième génération de BOS au Bénin et s’inscrit dans la mise en œuvre de la réforme des Nations Unies et vise à renforcer la mise en œuvre de l’UNDAF 2019 - 2023. Il est à noter que l’année 2022 a été la dernière année de la mise en œuvre de l’UNDAF 2019- 2023 qui a été écourté d’un an suivant la décision conjointe de l’Équipe Pays des Nations Unies au Bénin et le Gouvernement du Bénin. L’objectif de cette décision a été d’élaborer un nouveau Cadre de Coopération des Nations Unies pour le développement durable (UNSDCF-CC) pour la période 2023-2026 qui serait plus étroitement arrimé aux priorités du Gouvernement définies dans le Programme d’Action du Gouvernement 2021 – 2026 et de transitionner sur la nouvelle génération de l’UNCSDF.

L'Équipe Pays des Nations Unies (UNCT) au Bénin a mis en œuvre cette stratégie en 2022 dans le but général d'obtenir un plus grand impact en étant cohérent et efficace dans la fourniture de résultats de développement, tout en harmonisant les pratiques commerciales de toutes les agences pour une efficacité accrue.

La BOS s'est concentrée principalement sur les gains d'efficacité et l'évitement des coûts tout en améliorant simultanément la qualité des services, y compris les économies de coûts sur les biens et services d'origine externe et en éliminant la duplication des efforts, en tirant parti du pouvoir de négociation commun de l'ONU et en maximisant les économies d'échelle.

La stratégie consiste à se concentrer sur les services communs qui sont mis en œuvre conjointement ou fournis par une entité des Nations Unies au nom d'une ou plusieurs autres entités des Nations Unies. Les services communs dans les domaines suivants sont identifiés pour la collaboration : ressources humaines, information, communications et technologies (TIC), finances, approvisionnement, administration et logistique.

L'Équipe Pays des Nations Unies (UNCT) au Bénin consiste de 20 membres, comme suit : 12 Agences, fonds et programmes résidents (FAO, IOM, WFP, UNAIDS, UNCDF, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNESCO, UPU, WHO et UNOPS). 8 Agences, fonds et programmes non – résidents (ITC, OHCHR, ILO ; UNEP, UNIDO, UNWOMEN, HCDH, IFAD) (ayant des opérations au Bénin et participant dans le BOS dans le sens ou le financement des activités passe par des Agences résidentes)

La Banque Mondiale et le Fonds Monétaire International utilisent certains services communs.

Au Bénin, BOS vise à soutenir l'exécution efficace des programmes, le suivi et l'évaluation et l'établissement de rapports sur les opérations communes. Conçu pour être un document évolutif, le BOS 2.0 du Bénin continue d’être mis en œuvre et opérationnalisé par le biais de quatre (4) groupes de travail OMT (ressources humaines ; finances ; approvisionnement et logistique; TIC ), sous la direction de l'OMT pour soutenir la planification, le suivi et l'établissement de rapports conjoints. Les activités prévues dans le cadre de la BOS visent à améliorer la rentabilité, la qualité et l'efficacité du soutien de l'Équipe Pays des Nations Unies à l'exécution des programmes et aux opérations commerciales.

L’analyse coût-bénéfice a permis de calculer les avantages et les coûts qui pourraient être évités de la mise en place des différentes lignes de services identifiés à l’étape de l’analyse des besoins et opportunités. Au total, un montant estimé à 2,8 millions USD représente les coûts qui seront évités de la mise en œuvre du BOS au Bénin sur une période de cinq ans, avec la réalisation de 0.71 million USD de coûts effectivement évités en 2022.

Pour faciliter la mise en œuvre et le suivi, un cadre de résultats et de ressources ainsi que les différents indicateurs (KPI) ont été définis. Ces indicateurs permettent de mesurer non seulement les coûts évités mais aussi l’amélioration de la qualité des services communs pour toutes les AFPs."
BFA;Burkina Faso;317;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Business Operations Strategy 2.0 (2018-2023)

During the formulation of the new United Nations Framework Plan for Development Assistance (UNDAF 2018-2022) of the United Nations in Burkina-Faso, the OMT Team designed the BOS whose objective is to facilitate the implementation of the UNDSCF by identifying and setting up joint operational activities that are harmonized and at lower costs. This was in line with the adoption earlier in 2015, by Government, of delivery as one reform. It has also facilitated the implementation of the UNDAF between Burkina Faso and the United Nations System 2018-2022 extended for another year till 2023 and indirectly that of the “Plan National de Developpement Economique et Social” (PNDES 2016-2020). The BOS led to the establishment of directives and instruments with the aim of strengthening the links between the Framework Plan for Development (UNSDCF) and operations. This is a mandate exercise that accompanies the implementation of the United Nations assistance program to countries. The BOS is interested in joint operations and provides a strategic approach and results-oriented planning, management and for setting out harmonized programs to support operations across the country.

The methodological approach for the development of the Burkina Faso BOS is characterized by a participatory process including the Operations staff of United Nations in Burkina-Faso and was carried out in close consultation with the various results groups including the program group and the monitoring and evaluation group. The UNCT in Burkina Faso is comprised of 25 resident agencies with 8 non-resident UN agencies with responsibilities over the country. The following UN organizations are participating in the BOS 2.0 in Burkina Faso: FAO, UNDP, UNICEF, IOM, UNFPA, UNHCR, WFP, WHO, UNAIDS, IOM, ILO, UNIDO, UNESCO, UNCDF, UNODC, UN-Habitat, & OHCHR. (UNOPS is in the participating agency list which is a non resident agency and therefore it should be removed from the list).  The monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the BOS will be based on a two-level mechanism: (i) the strategic level led by the Country Team with the support of the Office of the Resident Coordinator; and (ii) the technical and operational level led by the OMT and the various working groups, with the support of the Office of the Resident Coordinator. In total, the effective implementation of the BOS was expected in the UN System in Burkina Faso to realize a cost avoidance by an estimated excess of approximately 3 million US $ for the period 2018-2020. The BOS 2.0 2018-2022 has been operationalized and implemented through six (06) OMT strategic working groups (common services administration, Common procurement, Common logistics, Common HACT and Finances, common ICT, Common Human resources) under the guidance of OMT to support joint planning.  The annual review as mandated by UNSG, started as of 10th January 2022 and pursued by the 6 Tasks Forces with the technical support of DCO/RCO at HQs and regional levels to assess to what extent the expected objectives were attained in all areas identified in the BOS 2.0 bearing in mind that the UNDAF framework was extended to 2023. The main findings of the BOS 2.0 review in terms of new opportunities to be jointly implemented will allow additional efficiency gains over the next year.

In addition, in order to ensure that High Impact Common Services are privileged, a specific common service aimed at ensuring staff well being was included to accompany staff needs in terms of counseling.

The joint implementation and use of common services in the BOS 2.0 allowed the UNCT Burkina Faso to avoid in the reviewed period of 2021 a cumulative amount of $ 1,086,944 below the previous projected total. While the OMT working groups planning process for the new period of 2022 a projected overall cost avoidance amount of $ 2,446,659 as a result of new common services included in the BOS for 2022."
BGD;Bangladesh;309;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The success of UN programmes at the country level is highly dependent on the effectiveness, efficiency, and cost of UN operations. In Bangladesh, the UN system has developed the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 2022-2026 (UNSDCF), which outlines the collective response of the UN development system to address key development priorities and challenges, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The UNSDCF aims to support Bangladesh in achieving the objectives of the 8th Five Year Plan and the 2030 Agenda, including the SDGs, as well as the Perspective Plan for 2041. To ensure that the UN programmes are implemented successfully, the UNCT agreed on a Business Operation Strategy (BOS) in 2020. Despite the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the UN system has recognized the BOS as a unique opportunity for agencies to collaborate and formalize existing common services while identifying new areas for a collective approach. With a focus on joint business operations, the BOS 2.0 aims to eliminate duplication, leverage the UN's collective bargaining power, and maximize economies of scale. All 19 UN entities have participated in this exercise through the Operations Management Team (OMT).

The BOS implementation began with 33 proposed common services, expected to contribute to an estimated cost avoidance of USD 2,739,060 over five years. However, during the 2021 BOS review, working groups under OMT dropped 11 activities deemed unrealistic, reducing the estimated cost avoidance to USD 2,034,481 from 22 common services. Despite this, the BOS remains a crucial initiative that will continue to drive collective efforts and bring about positive change in the UN system.

Even though some activities planned for 2022 are in the final stage of completion , there are no realized cost benefits. During the review process, most of the activities were moved from 2022 to the following years since the collaboration was not completed or finalized. The OMT is confident that successful implementation of the BOS will improve service quality and efficiency. The following progress has been made on the key activities under the BOS agenda in 2022:  

- Systematic sharing of vacancy notices within agencies and use of agency personnel in interview panels to increase transparency and ensure fair hiring practices.
- Contribution to the development of a Gender Parity Strategy to promote gender equality in the workplace.
- Support for Training for Trainers on PSA (Personal Security Awareness) and SHAA (Sexual Harassment and Assault Awareness) to enhance staff safety and well-being.
- Strengthened relationship with the National Board of Revenue and timely refund of VAT  The huge backlog of pending refunds was reduced significantly.
- Improved client services with SCB (Standard Chartered Bank)that helped in day to to day operational efficiency including a special treatment to the UN to cater to its demand for USD cash during the time of USD shortage..
- Establishment of a uniform USD exchange rate for all agencies for inward remittance to facilitate financial transactions.
- Finalization of LTA for the vehicle rental and work in progress for LTA for cleaning services to optimize resource allocation and cost-effectiveness.
- Consolidation of Common Premises data to improve management and utilization of shared facilities.
- Streamlining of hotel rates to ensure consistency and fairness in accommodation expenses.
- Gender-Responsive Procurement workshop to promote gender-sensitive procurement practices.
- Development of an LTA tracker to improve monitoring and evaluation of procurement processes.
- Maximization of the use of existing LTAs to optimize resource utilization and reduce redundancy.

BHR;Bahrain;308;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"In line with the Secretary-Generals UN reform targets Bahrain has designed a BOS (2020-2022) in support of a more effective programme delivery on the 2030 Agenda. With six UN agencies (UN RCO, UNDP, FAO, IOM, UNFPA, WHO) are collaborating mainly in the areas of Common Administration services, Common Finance services, Common Procurement services. The aim of this Business Operations Strategy is to further improve the quality, timeliness, and cost-effectiveness of participating UN agencies operations resulting in cost avoidance and savings since working as ONE allows for better utilization of resources and collective bargaining due to increase in volume. This cost avoidance is different to savings as it is not reflected in terms of financial gains in budget but rather leads to less recurrent and labor costs.  The review stage includes the projection from 2020 till 2024 and the estimated cost avoidance for that period is $198,563 against which we have a realized gains of $34,783 for 2020, 2021 and 2022. There is a drop in the projected cost avoidance due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on convening activities and because in the last cycle all services provided by UNDP on HQ bilateral SLA agreement were included which is now removed and also due to reduction in common services requests since most agencies have settled in the country and are established.

Bahrain committed to strengthen 9 common services under 3 common service lines especially the potential high yielding services being, establishment of common LTAs in Travel, Printing/Graphic Design, Catering Services, Security Services and Cleaning Services. The LTAs for travel, printing/graphic design and catering are still to be established. They are delayed due to reprioritization of services required. Further, the government provides office space and maintenance for the UN House as in-kind contribution, as well as funding for the UN House running costs.

The Resident Coordinator is accountable to the Secretary-General for the development, implementation, monitoring and reporting of the BOS and steps towards a common back office. The UNCT provides overall oversight of the BOS process, approval and release of necessary agency and joint resources, sign off of the final BOS and annual reporting. The Operations Management Team, chaired by UNDP, and its subsidiary bodies are responsible to facilitate development and implementation of the BOS at the country level with the support from DCO regional office. At the implementation level, it is the responsibility of the managing agency of each common service to achieve the yearly planned targets in close coordination and collaboration of the designated working group.

BIH;Bosnia and Herzegovina;315;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"In line with the Secretary-General's UN reform targets, on 24/02/2021 Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) designed a BOS in support of a more effective programme delivery on the 2030 Agenda, with participation of the following UN Agencies: FAO, ILO, IOM, UNDP, UNESCO, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNFPA, UNWOMEN, WHO, UNS RCOs and UNS DSS.

Ingrid MACDONALD, the Resident Coordinator, is accountable to the Secretary-General for the development, implementation, monitoring and reporting of the BOS and steps towards a common back office. The UNCT provides overall oversight of the BOS process, approval and release of necessary agency and joint resources, sign off of the final BOS and annual reporting. The Operations Management Team (chaired by Svetlana PAVELIC) and its subsidiary bodies are responsible to facilitate development and implementation of the BOS at the country level. The Development Coordination Office (DCO) is responsible for coordination, guidance and support to UNCTs and RCs on the BOS.

BiH BOS runs parallel to and complements the Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 2021 – 2025 between BiH authorities and the UN system in all five Outcomes and, especially, its first of four priorities: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and selected SDGs and targets as expressed in the emerging SDG Framework in BiH and domesticated SDG targets.

BiH BOS 2021 – 2025 builds on the ongoing efforts by the UN Country Team to harmonize and simplify its business operations, to enhance operational support to the programmatic activities as well as it aims to introduce new opportunities for UNCT collaboration and initiatives in this five-year period. Given that UN system in BiH has had an established UN House comprising common premises and services since 2013 as well as BOS ‘light’ in the period 2014 – 2017, most of the benefits arising from numerous common services identified within the previous BOS have already been achieved. The new BOS focuses primarily on enhancing the quality of these services and increasing cost avoidance, but it also envisages raise of cast avoidance on externally sourced goods and services and, very importantly, widening cooperation of the UN agencies in the areas of administration and ICT. It is important to note that cost avoidance does not equal savings as it is not reflected in terms of financial gains in the budget but rather leads to lower recurrent and labor costs.

New BOS represents a simplified - yet comprehensive, integrated and coherent framework, reflecting instruments for quantified cost-benefit analysis, results-based planning, monitoring and evaluation. BiH BOS 2.0 reflects five out of six common service areas: Common Administration Services (including common premises and services), Common Finance Services, Common Human Resource Services, Common ICT Services and Common Procurement. In 2022, BiH BOS Agencies continue cooperating in 47 common services.

At the time of BOS development (end of February 2021) it was estimated that, as a result of its full implementation over the five years, total benefit would be over USD 2.1 mil. The 2022 BOS annual review showed the decrease of total benefit to USD 1.9 mil. However, the amount of cost avoidance realized in 2022 was USD 363,557, whilst the estimate was USD 371,948. It is worth mentioning that majority of the cost avoidance resulted from Common Admin services - more particularly of the management of common premises and travel, set of 8 common ICT services and banking services.

Specific effort of the OMT in 2023 will be invested on advancing quality assurance of common services as well as moving forward with the realization of the 2023 implementation plan."
BLR;Belarus;310;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The ongoing conflict in Ukraine and subsequent sanctions on Belarus deepened the socioeconomic crises of post electoral and COVID period of 2020-21 and caused significant challenge for Belarusian economy, livelihoods, and well-being of people. From the onset of the conflict (Feb 2022) Partnerships with EUD and EU member states, US, UK, and other partners shrunk in volume and context. IFIs have suspended their activities in Belarus.

The list of sanctions is steadily increasing. Considerable number of international companies suspended its business in Belarus and Russia. Sanctions on air and land cargo, and closure of border crossing points restricted availability of selected goods in local market and delivery from abroad. Delivery of goods became more expensive and unpredictable time wise. Restrictions on the banking sector (major banks and multiple intermediary bank accounts are under sanctions, several state banks are disconnected from SWIFT) cause dis-functionalities in the banking system which continue to mount. The prolongation of regional instability is increasing probability of military operations and threat of terrorism attacks in the country.

The agencies are constantly adjusting their programming and operations to the fast-changing context, focusing on security and duty of care. Accordingly, security level for Belarus was increased from “low” to “moderate”, as well as the crisis level L3 was declared by the UNDP Crisis Board.

The BOS for Belarus include common services in the areas of administration, finance, procurement and human resources. In the existing operational environment, it has been quite challenging to expand further BOS services due to the following: (i) agencies have small presence and limited capacity to invest in expanding common services;   (ii) agencies continue to be housed in separate premises; (iii) long-term procurement arrangements are seriously impeded by negative developments in the local market or not feasible.

The UNCT and OMT will continue to monitor the situation and look for ways to upscale BOS common services to achieve better efficiency and quality of agencies’ operations in the country. "
BLZ;Belize;311;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The typology for UN operations in Belize is categorized as small with an annual expenditure of below USD 40 million.  There are functionally eleven UN entities with county presence comprising Representative offices, UNDP, UNICEF, PAHO/WHO, IOM, UNHCR, and separate liaison/project office – UNFPA, UNOPS/SGP, FAO, WFP and ILO. Furthermore, the UNRCO is present with other UN entities are embedded in agencies, notably UNDSS. Nine UN entities are participating in the BOS. UN entities are largely based in the two main urban centers, Belmopan, the administrative and political capital and Belize City, the commercial center and most populous city. 

The annual review of the Business Operations Strategy (BOS) for Belize for the period 2021 – 2025 was undertaken in the first Quarter of 2023; approved by the UN Country Team on April 11th 2023 and signed by the UN RC on April 13th 2023.  The Operations Management Team and Working Groups from most of the Resident Agencies were responsible for revising and presenting the draft BOS for review and approval by the UNCT.

 The review of the BOS in 2023 benefitted from the regular sessions coordinated by DCO; Common Premise training of OMT counterparts and BOS training of the RCO Team Leader in 2022.  Furthermore the OMT and WGs had two full day sessions to facilitate the coordinated review in February 2023.  

The BOS review resulted in a number of changes.  First with the RCO being clarified as an agency the generic UN agency was removed from participation and the main engagement specified as the RCO.  Additionally, PAHO advised that due to their specific context they could not participate in the BOS at this time.  Finally, it was determined that the GEF/SGP would be included under UNDP and therefore the UNOPS as an agency was no longer continued as a separate entity.

Regarding the services, note 6 common services were discontinued largely as the agencies saw no functional advantage for continuing or one of the two participating agencies determined it was no longer relevant.  Additionally, 6 new common services were agreed.

Estimated benefit over the period of the BOS of $2.8M with about 250K realised to date.  In 2021, 400K was estimated and 36K realised while in 2022, 188K was estimated and 213K was realised. Of the continuing Common Services, 11 have CBAs and 17 have no CBAs for a total of 28 common services. The Common Services with the greatest cumulative expected benefit are vehicle rental and management of the common premises with $543K and $498K respectively."
BOL;Bolivia;314;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"El equipo de administradores de las operaciones de las agencias del Sistema de Naciones Unidas en Bolivia (con las siglas en inglés OMT), ha venido desarrollando actividades conjuntas durante los últimos 15 años y obtuvo por primera vez la aprobación de una estrategia de operaciones institucionales (con las siglas en inglés BOS) en 2016, con la finalidad de mejorar la rentabilidad y calidad de los procesos y de evitar la duplicidad de esfuerzos. 

El Coordinador Residente y el UNCT (United Nations Country Team) conjuntamente, promueven medidas específicas para promover las operaciones comunes de la ONU, incluida la implementación de la Estrategia de Operaciones Conjuntas (Business Operations Strategy - BOS), en un esfuerzo por permitir el trabajo conjunto y generar eficiencias de costos y ganancias de calidad en el apoyo operativo a la implementación de programas.

Estos esfuerzos han permitido durante el 2022 reducir los costos operativos de las Agencias del Sistema de Naciones Unidas (SNU), por aproximadamente USD 162.000. Por otro lado, se ha proyectado alcanzar una reducción de costos para los 3 próximos años por un importe aproximado de USD 413.000 (año 2023 USD 154.000, año 2024 USD 147.000 y año 2025 USD 112.000).

Como parte de los resultados se realizaron una serie de acciones conjuntas interagenciales resumidas en los siguientes acápites:

Línea de servicios de Tecnología:
-   Uso de plataformas y aplicaciones comunes como Teams utilizado para reuniones conjuntas.  Asimismo, se estaría explorando mayores usos en plataformas comunes para 2023.

Mayores beneficios de estos esfuerzos podrán ser recibidos y medidos en los años venideros; sin embargo, se debe alentar continuamente la participación de las agencias en el trabajo conjunto y en el análisis de los beneficios de estos.

Por otra parte, se ha realizado el monitoreo de paridad de género de personal en el SNU, así como personal con todo tipo de contrato de las siguientes agencias: OIM, ONU HABITAT, ONUDI, UNV, OIT, PMA, UNDSS, UNFPA, UNWOMEN, OACNUDH FAO, PNUD, UNICEF, UNODC, CINU, OPS/OMS y OCR, habiéndose alcanzado la paridad del 51.99% mujeres y 48.01% varones.

Con relación al UNCT se tiene 47% mujeres y 53% hombres, estamos por debajo de la paridad de género a nivel del SNU. 

Este análisis será realizado a través del OMT a fin de coadyuvar en el monitoreo de paridad de género a nivel del SNU."
BRA;Brazil;399;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The Business Operations Strategy (BOS) represents an important step in the process of strengthening the coherence and harmonization of the interventions of the agencies, funds, programs and entities in the country. It is an instrument that enables UN entities to strategically analyze its operations and identify opportunities to advance on joint operations arrangements, focusing on cost-efficient and effective local solutions. Its implementation foresees to generate important gains in staff working hours as well as important financial savings and aims to increase the quality of operational services in the next years, thus strengthening the overall programme delivery of the UN System in Brazil.

The BOS Annual Review 2023 aims at reviewing the participant entities, the existing catalogue of common services, assessing the possibility of implementing the highly recommended ones and, finally, reviewing the cost benefit analysis and recording the actual status of implementation of the common services included in the Planning Framework in the areas of Procurement, Logistics, Administration, Finance, Human Resources, and ICT.  Brazil has an estimated cost avoidance of US$2,04 Mi, out of which US$ 1,17Mi already realized.

I would like to commend the UN Operations Management Team and its working groups composed of the entities from the UN System in Brazil on developing this strategy and its annual review for 2023.

BRB;Barbados;272;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The UN Agencies in Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean have jointly collaborated and committed to develop this Business Operations Strategy (BOS). The BOS provides a Results Based Framework for operational support to the implementation of the United Nations Multi-Country Sustainable Development Framework (UN MSDF) of the Caribbean (2022-2026). It focuses on a practical and realistic consolidation of common services implemented among the agencies to achieve better results and improved efficiencies whilst reducing the burden on the agencies’ personnel. The BOS covers a five-year cycle from 2022 to 2026 but will be reviewed and adjusted as needed to match the needs of the UN MSDF.

In developing the BOS, the OMT considered the challenges of varying agency structures, different operational systems, differing countries of coverage, but found common ground in how collaboration could be achieved among the agencies. It focused on how the agencies could use existing resources to achieve better qualities of service at reduced costs, work more effectively and efficiently, and considered what new/additional resources were needed.  UN Agencies had been collaborating for over 10 years hence cost avoidance is embedded in regular activities, synergies and common activities are implemented periodically.  The BOS platform limit opportunities to capture common activities where no cost avoidance is reported, this requires an update to enable countries with similar scenario to reflect these in the system.   

A review of operational spending in Procurement, ICT, HR, Logistics, Finance and Premises/ Facility for the years 2021 and 2022 was done, considering volume and value of expenditure per annum and per month. The 10 highest areas of spending in value and volume were identified as the priority areas for review. The Planning Framework of the Top  services had been formulated and there is no foreseen budget Gap. 

For the 2022 review, PAHO decided to withdraw from BOS working groups.  For this review the OMT collaborated in the review     

 In the following year (2023), the OMT would consider focusing on three priority areas: staff wellbeing, greening, and disability and inclusion. Activities are been identified and the team is collaborating on preparing the implementation plan for 2023.

The participating agencies are as follows:
FAO - Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
ITU - International Telecommunication Union
PAHO/WHO - Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization
UNDP - United Nations Development Programme
UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund
UNICEF -  United Nations Children’s Fund
UN WOMEN - United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women
UN WFP – United Nations World Food Programme"
BTN;Bhutan;313;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"With majority of UN agencies housed under one roof, UN Bhutan provides a comparative advantage when it comes to agencies working cohesively together, sharing resources and pooling services such a s reception services, facility management and other Common Services. In addition, the Business Operations Strategy (BOS) platform provides the mechanism for the UN to realize efficiency gains and quality enhancement to support UN goals and objective. The collaborations are underway in five common service areas: Administration; Finance; Human Resources; ICT and Procurement.

Within the agreed services, the UN in Bhutan has prioritized 41 common service activities and successful implementation of the BOS will include harmonization of relevant administrative processes, reduced duplication of staffing efforts, improved service quality and cost savings in several areas. Since the BOS implementation from 2019 to date, the Bhutan UNCT has achieved 83% of the estimated total cost avoidance target of 767K mainly from Environmental sustainability management, premises management and security services.

The Business Operations Strategy (BOS) annual review outcomes of 2022 and priorities for 2023 presented on the platform are reflections of rigorous data exercise and office wide participation of staff.  The review also carefully looked at the original cost avoidance target and three following basic principles of calculating cost benefit analysis was used:
1. Cost efficiencies are not calculated in comparison to the market rate in order to avoid hypothetical cost benefit. Therefore, in most cases the future cost and current cost is kept constant especially for recurring cost.
2. Business process mapping methodology was used for common service unit services, ICT services, HR services while Universal Price List was used to calculate the labor cost for Admin Services, Procurement and Finance Services.
3. Common services established prior to 2019 (Legacy Common Services) resulting to continued cost benefit for the participating entities were recorded, especially in terms of labor cost.

The review outcome confirmed that the BOS implementation has contributed to implementation of Secretary General’s efficiency agenda where we saw 65% of the realized cost was due to labour cost avoidance created due to common premise management and capitalizing on services provided by bigger agencies such as UNDP and UNICEF. Further, it worked as a core organizing principles of UN Bhutan’s programme and management. The cost avoidance and efficiency remained a core priority for which a number of high impact activities were implemented.

The UN Bhutan invested heavily and achieved in number of transformational results in line with Sustainable Development Goals. Every change process has to be strategically managed, thus OMT worked towards building the operations to become 21st century operations staff who are consciously contributing towards achieving cost efficiency, quality improvement and to the UN sustainable goals. OMT used the following methods for strengthening the accountability amongst members and to integrate change for sustainable development:
- Issuance of letter of appointment and TOR for OMT and working groups
- Monthly monitoring of BOS activity progress by the working groups to OMT
- Identifying performance goal for OMT & Working groups for inclusion in their individual annual performance plan.
- Initiating alignment of BOS initiatives to the CCA identified opportunity in order to facilitate integration of CF into BOS implementation.

Besides above initiative some of the other high impact achievements includes:
1. Working towards achieving carbon neutrality, the UN has discontinued the use of single-use plastic within the UN House and with all the long-term agreement hotels, which has eliminated the consumption of 28K plastic bottles per year. Implemented waste segregation facilities contribute to the Egg Tray Factory youth initiative, and an investment in five hybrid vehicles and two electric cars has contributed to an ever-greening fleet of cars.
2. In line with Business Operation Strategy 2.0 the installation of a photovoltaic solar system completed in 2021, continues to offset 97% of the electricity consumption of the UN House and exported 2.4% to grid till date.
3. In line with UNSDG 13- Climate Action, the OMT established a common UN carpool system consisting of 3 cars (2 hybrid and one electric vehicle). Using low-level emissions (cars provided by UNDP, UNICEF and WFP) reducing harmful gas emissions, minimize vehicle use through an effective carpooling option and encourage less fleet maintenance for smaller agencies who can now rely on larger organizations for transportation.
4. Noting the urgent need for the UN system to improve its performance with regard to disability inclusion, initiated annual consultation with the Organization for People with Disability on UNDIS implementation at the UN House, to ensure optimum accessibility for persons with disabilities, on an equal basis with others.
5. In order to foster a healthy and vibrant atmosphere, workplace spaces were enhanced with new design exterior space of the cafeteria to accommodate more people for informal meetings, coffee breaks and to create space for people to interact and build meaningful partnership.

The 2023 priorities are set through a well-planned process and survey with 80% staff participation. The list of priorities paid more attention staff wellbeing, on cross learning among agencies. Further emphasis on greening initiatives, inclusive working environment and bigger ambition for efficiency gain through more efficient and collaborative business processes is incorporated into the 2023 workplan.

BWA;Botswana;316;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The One UN Botswana Business Operations Strategy (BOS) 2021-2025 is a medium-term strategic plan that focuses on One UN support services to the One UN Botswana Programme (UNBPF) and on benefits and opportunities arising from inter-agency coordination and cooperation on support service functions. The BOS is a response to the UN reform which seeks to establish a coordinated UN by 2022.

The BOS focuses primarily on efficiency gains, cost avoidance and reduction of costs through agencies working together. It will reduce internal transaction costs and provide cost savings on externally sourced goods and services. It will do so by building on the lessons learnt on how to improve the Operating as One management mechanisms, and by systematically implementing already established good practices on high impact transactions/activities across the One UN Botswana. Furthermore, UNCT prioritized the need to provide technical support to OMT on mainstreaming gender in BOS activities. In this BOS, the UN which initially was included as a representative of several agencies- being UNDSS, UNDPA and RCO has now been removed from the collaboration and split into stand alone agencies of UNS-DSS; UNS-RCOs.  In addition, UNICEF hosts UNESCO in shared premises and similarly in the OMT. 

The BOS is structured around four key operation areas, that is: Information, Communication and Technology (ICT), Human Resources (HR), Finance, and Administrative Services.

The UNCT has agreed to collaborate on internet connectivity and through the BOS, they will do so for both the primary and secondary link, cumulatively avoiding a total of $412 382.00 in costs. The UNCT in agreeing to this arrangement, decommissioned the VSAT link, which resulted in most of the savings and engaged local contractors as the internet services and connectivity have generally improved in the country. To date, the UNCT has realized $303 599.00 in cost benefit on joint internet service. Furthermore, UNCT have realized an opportunity to collaborate in the procurement of mobile phone services and scratch cards with the view to avoid $32 252.00 in future expenses.

Through the HR pillar, UNCT has agreed to 2 activities which do not require changes in systems or policies; being- surveys (place to place surveys, DSA survey and local salary surveys). Further to this, UNCT have agreed to collaborate on PSEA training in order to increase awareness and understanding of PSEA and how to report such cases, upscale UN Cares and UN Day activities and increase the number of medical services available to staff in the country.

Three Agencies that use the common HACT framework (UNICEF, UNFPA and UNDP) have agreed to collaborating within the Finance pillar. The activities relate to the Macro and Micro assessment and capacity building of Implementing Partners. This collaboration is anticipated to result in a total of $33 745.00 in cost avoidance/future benefit. UNCT has also agreed to collaborate on a unified approach for tax refunds and exemption for a harmonized approach to tax claims from 2023.

The Administrative pillar is the second pillar where the most future benefit will be derived after ICT as this is where most of the common LTAs are administered. On annual basis, the OMT will determine based on Agency spending, what savings they could derive if they consolidated their administrative procurements such as printing, translation services etc. In this BOS, the UNCT has agreed to consolidate Security, Cleaning, and Stationary.  Through this collaboration, Administrative services are expected to yield a total of $252 672.00 in future benefit for the UNCT. To date, the UNCT has already realized $200 113.00 in cost benefit.

Essentially, the UNCT anticipates a cumulative cost avoidance of $671 799.00 (in both recurring and labour costs); of which $505 652.00 has been realized."
CAF;Central African Republic;322;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Dans le souci de mutualiser les efforts et de rationaliser la mise en œuvre du Cadre de coopération pour l’assistance au développement (UNDAF + 2018-2021, prolongé jusqu’en 2022), l'équipe pays des Nations Unies (UNCT) en RCA a développé sa stratégie des opérations commerciales (BOS) 2.0 (2021–2023) pour coordonner avec plus d’efficacité et d’efficience ses activités opérationnelles, afin de tirer profit du pouvoir de négociation inter-agences et maximiser les économies d’échelle.

En effet, l’UNDAF+ 2018-2022 est aligné sur les priorités du plan national pour le relèvement et la consolidation de la paix en RCA auxquelles il contribue. Toutes les interventions seront destinées à appuyer la réalisation des objectifs prioritaires du RCPCA. Il s’inscrit dans le cadre de l’Agenda 2030 des Objectifs du développement durable (ODD) et de l’Agenda 2063 de l’Union Africaine, « l’Afrique que nous voulons ».

Les Nations Unies prendront en compte les risques majeurs identifiés à travers les analyses communes de la situation (tels que l’insécurité, l’exclusion et la marginalisation des femmes et des filles, la stigmatisation des certains groupes vulnérables, le rejet du processus de désarmement, démobilisation, réinsertion et retour (DDRR) par certains groupes armés non conventionnels, pénurie du carburant et la variation du prix du carburant, l’instabilité institutionnelle, les catastrophes naturelles, y inclus les effets du dérèglement climatiques susceptibles d’exacerber les vulnérabilités, et la crise financière) et qui pourraient avoir un impact sur l’engagement des partenaires. La mise en œuvre de l’UNDAF+ 2018-2021 ainsi que de l’UNSDCF obéira au même esprit de mutualisation des ressources et des initiatives programmatiques des agences des Nations Unies et de la MINUSCA avec une dimension opérationnelle assurée à travers le Business Operations Strategy (BOS), signé par l’ensemble de l’équipe pays du SNU en RCA pour la période 2021-2023.

Le BOS est un cadre axé sur les résultats qui se concentre sur les opérations commerciales conjointes dans le but d'éliminer les duplications des coûts, de tirer parti du pouvoir de négociation inter-agences au sein du système des Nations unies et de maximiser ainsi les économies d'échelle. La BOS 2.0 (2021-23) a été développée sur la plateforme en ligne du BOS à partir du 1er juillet 2020 et a été finalisée en juin 2021. La première revue annuelle du BOS a été conduite entre janvier et Mars 2022 et permis d’actualiser la liste des agences participantes, le cadre de redevabilité, d’entreprendre l’état des lieux des services communs, de conduire l’analyse et l’identification de nouvelles opportunités de collaboration inter-agences ; et d’actualiser le cadre de planification. Le BOS se concentre sur les services communs qui sont mis en œuvre conjointement ou fournis par une agence du SNU au nom d'une ou plusieurs autres agences du SNU. Des services communs pour une collaboration futur ont été identifiés dans les domaines suivants : l’administration, services financiers communs, services de ressources humaines communs, services de technologies de l'information et des communications communs, logistique commune et services d'achats. Les agences du système des Nations Unies participantes au BOS 2.0 en RCA inclus : UNICEF, PNUD, PAM, HCR, FAO, OIM, ONUSIDA, FNUAP, OCHA, UNOPS, UNMAS, ONUFEMMES, OMS, ainsi que le Bureau du coordinateur Mohamed Ayoya  le Représentant spéciale adjointe du Secrétaire général des Nations Unies, et Coordinateur résident et humanitaire des Nations Unies (RC/ HC), en poste depuis janvier  2023 est responsable devant le Secrétaire général du développement, de la mise en œuvre, du suivi et du rapportage du BOS 2.0. L'équipe pays des Nations Unies assure la supervision générale du processus BOS 2.0, l'approbation et la délibération des organisations des Nations Unies et des ressources conjointes nécessaires, la signature de la version finale du BOS 2.0 et le rapport annuel. L'équipe de gestion des opérations (OMT) dont la présidence, tournante tous les ans est assurée en 2022 par le Directeur pays du PAM et co-présidé par le Représentant du HCR à travers leur Adjoints respectifs Mme Peggy Pedre et Rushatsi Jean Bosco ainsi que ses cinq groupes thématiques sont chargés de faciliter le développement et la mise en œuvre du BOS au niveau national. Le Bureau de coordination du développement (DCO) est responsable de la coordination, de l'orientation et du soutien de l'équipe de pays des Nations Unies et du Coordonnateur résident des Nations Unies sur le BOS 2.0.

La nouvelle itération du BOS est également soutenue par une plateforme en ligne qui guide l'équipe de gestion des opérations (OMT) pour réduire davantage la complexité et les coûts de transaction pour le développement du BOS et ouvre de nouvelles opportunités pour l'OMT et l'UNCT de surveiller, d’analyser et de rendre compte de l'impact du BOS, tant du point de vue de la réduction des coûts que de l'amélioration de la qualité et renforcer la collaboration interagence

Étant un document évolutif, le BOS 2.0 (2021 - 2023) sera mis en œuvre et opérationnalisé par cinq groupes de travail stratégiques de l'OMT (Administration commune, Achats & logistique ; Finances & HACT, Technologie de l’information et communication ; et Ressources humaines) sous la direction de l'OMT pour soutenir la planification conjointe, le suivi et le rapport des résultats. Les activités inter-agences à mettre en œuvre dans les domaines susmentionnés viseront à améliorer la rentabilité (un total de 4.286.205 USD d'évitement des coûts), la qualité et l'efficacité du soutien de l'équipe de pays des Nations Unies à l'exécution des programmes et aux opérations commerciales. Au moment de finaliser la revue annuelle, plusieurs agences dont le PAM, L’UNICEF, Le PNUD, OIM, OCHA ont initié des discussions avec l’ONG internationale AIRD, partenaire du HCR dans le souci de mutualiser les efforts et parvenir à la rationalisation des couts de réparation et d’entretien de véhicules à travers la signature de mémorandum d’entente dans l’esprit de unis dans l’action.             A l ’issue des négociations en cours, le montant d’évitement des couts sera actualisé en conséquence. Pendant cette période, l’équipe pays est parvenu à actualiser l’état des lieux des locaux communs, dont le taux de réalisation est passé de 77% entre janvier 2022 et le 15 mars 2023 sans la contribution de la MINUSCA qui reste conditionné à la réception des directives attendues du Siege des services de la MINUSCA a New York. Le Coordonnateur Résident du système des NU en RCA se réjouis tout particulièrement des efforts remarquables accomplis par l’équipe pays pour faire avancer l’agenda sur l’efficacité.

NOTA BENE  : The OMT co-chairs are expected to prepare this high-level narrative before BOS is submitted for Quality Assurance. This narrative should focus on conclusions of the BOS at the outcome level, provide a short overview of UNCT decisions, and BOS’s overall impact on cost avoidance and quality improvements. The narrative should refer to resources commitment by the UNCT both financial (BOS Budget) and human resources (staff time)"
CHL;Chile;324;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"En base a los solicitado por el Secretario General de Naciones Unidas y la Resolución de la Asamblea General 71/23, donde se insta implementar la Estrategia de Operaciones Conjuntas BOS el 24 de abril de 2020, UNCT-Chile dio inicio al BOS 2.0. 

El BOS es un marco de estrategia que se centra en operaciones comerciales conjuntas y que permite al Equipo de País de las Naciones Unidas (United Nations Country Team, UNCT, por sus siglas en inglés) adoptar un enfoque estratégico y orientado a los resultados para la eficiente planificación, gestión e implementación de operaciones comerciales armonizadas en a nivel país. Es una herramienta flexible y estratégica que permite que el UNCT se centre en las necesidades programáticas contextuales y específicas de sus miembros, a la vez que proporciona un sistema de monitoreo, registro, evaluación y reporte de fácil acceso y uso para mejor administrar las operaciones conjuntas. En este sentido, proporciona, a nivel país, un enfoque estratégico y centralizado a los servicios de apoyo operativo y a las iniciativas encaminadas a reforzar los vínculos entre el Marco de Cooperación el Desarrollo Sostenible y el apoyo operacional a los programas de las Naciones Unidas. 

Para avanzar en el BOS, el UNCT de Chile se ha apoyado en el Operations Management Team (OMT) conformado por CEPAL, FAO, OIT, PNUD, UNESCO y UNICEF, liderado por el/la representante de CEPAL. Durante este tiempo la Oficina de Coordinación Residente ha brindado seguimiento a la función del OMT de elaborar e implementar el BOS, e informar los avances al Secretariado.

En el caso de Chile, es importante señalar que ACNUR, ONU-Mujeres, UNFPA y PMA tienen sus instalaciones en las dependencias del Edificio del PNUD/FAO y operan bajo la administración del PNUD. Por su parte, la UIT comparte instalaciones con la OIT y depende administrativamente de dicha agencia. Por último, el UNCCD se aloja en las oficinas de CEPAL.

En marzo 2020 la propuesta acordada del UNCT de Chile fue trabajar inicialmente sobre 9 iniciativas que buscaban cumplir con los objetivos principales del BOS 2.0, evitando mayores costos, duplicidad de trabajo y dando prioridad a brindar mejor calidad de servicios.

Las iniciativas propuestas fueron las siguientes:
1.- Servicios de Limpieza y Aseo
2.- Servicio de Seguridad (Guardias)
3.- Servicio de mantención equipos de Aire Acondicionado (HVAC)
4.- Servicio de mantención de Ascensores
5.- Servicio de mantención de Generadores Eléctricos
6.- Servicio de mantención Central Incendio y Control de Acceso (Seguridad Física)
7.- Servicio de máquinas multifuncionales (Impresoras)
8.- Servicio Médico
9.- Contrato de Viajes 

El año 2021 se implementaron los servicios de Mantención de Ascensores y la continuidad de los servicios de Impresoras (Multifuncionales) y Seguridad, además se descontinuó el Servicio Médico.

En el año 2022 se continuó con la implementación de servicios, tales como los de Mantención de generadores eléctricos y de Mantención de equipos de aire acondicionado, lográndose una reducción de costos de USD 117,173 para un acumulado durante el período que abarca el BOS de USD 279,933. Adicionalmente, durante 2022 se avanzó en la preparación de las bases conjuntas para la licitación de la agencia de viajes. Esperamos para el 2023 sumar otras iniciativas de colaboración, así como implementar el servicio de Limpieza y Aseo. "
CHN;China;400;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The United Nations Country Team (UNCT) supported the formulation of a Business Operations Strategy (2019-2020) for UN China. The BOS strategy was developed by an independent consultant in close cooperation and consultation with the OMT and the UNCT and was endorsed in May 2019.  The China BOS includes a Results Framework which summarizes the BOS outcomes and projected outputs for the 2019-2020 period. The BOS outcome areas include procurement, human resources, finance, ICT and administrations. To operationalize the BOS, five working groups have been constituted covering these 5 outcomes and each of the WGs is led by a designated agency, which is tasked with the implementation of the workstreams, as part of the OMT, which in turn reports to the UNCT. 

The context that frames the China BOS includes the following: UN presence of 24 UN Funds, Programmes and Specialized agencies;  and a dispersed physical presence with some agencies either co-located within different diplomatic compounds or at separate locations across Beijing, resulting in operational imperatives on efficient and harmonized operations.

The BOS is designed at no extra cost involved as all human resources and other expertise shall come from internal staff resources of agencies.

The major factors impacted overall China efficiency gains:

1) the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020–2022, having a particular impact on travel, which was one of the main expected efficiency contributors. In addition, as fewer in-person events were organized in the past three years, the transport and printing costs decreased as well.
2) Internal changes with some UN Agencies (e.g., policies and procedures of different agencies, centralized operations services, relocation of office premises) resulting with some of them opting out for some common services.

Overall, the BOS focuses on increasing the efficiency and effectiveness as well as reducing the cost of the operations among UNCT through reducing unnecessary labour cost, duplicate spending and improving risk management. In the short term, these benefits will take the form of streamlined processes, better quality analysis and reporting, greater transparency and savings. In the longer term, these benefits must take the form of faster and better progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.

Total 18 agencies (including UNESCO, FAO, UNHCR, UNIDO, UNFPA, UNS-RCOs, UNS-UNEP, IFAD, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNICEF, ICAO, WHO, UN WOMEN, WFP, ILO, IOM, UNS-UN Habitat) conducted annual review exercise and maintained each agency’s data on the BOS system.

BOS annual review 2022-2023

China UNCT through the UN OMT engagement conducted BOS annual review in February 2023 providing actual results for 2022 and further projections 2023.

UNOMT and the BOS focal points has a in-depth discussion on 7 Feb 2023. Most of the previously identified common services through the stock take exercise as well new brought through the BOS implementation will continue.

The main changes include:

At the UNOMT and BOS annual review meeting on February 7, 2023, agencies decided to discontinue the following current common services:

1) the Common ICT Disaster Recovery Plan. Since each agency has to use its own technology and platforms and follow its own ICT management strategy, there is no need for an extra plan for all agencies in China.
2) the Vendor assessments and contract management service. Agencies agreed that this service is included in the LTA establishment and LTA renewal process, in the common Admin service lines we selected. To avoid duplicating information, this common Procurement service line was discontinued.
3)  the Gardening Service. The gardening service was included in the LTA for cleaning and gardening package services. Relevant data was indicated in the cleaning service line. To avoid duplicating information, this common Admin service line was discontinued.

In addition, the following common service lines were newly added in this round of BOS annual review exercise.

1) Gender Parity, Job Posting, Mapping of Disability Inclusion HR Practices, PSEA, in Common HR services
2) HACT management, in Common Finance services
3) Accessibility (Disability and Inclusion) in Procurement, Environmental Responsive Procurement Sourcing, Gender Responsive Procurement Sourcing, in Common Procurement services
4) OMT common platform, Network infrastructure services, Mapping of Digital and Web Accessibility, in Common ICT services
5) Assets/equipment management including disposal, Catering services, Conference and event management, in Common Admin services.

OMT China will review the progress of this year's workplan every two months. WGs will meet and coordinate with each other to carry out the planned activities on a more frequent basis. If extra time is needed for the WG to work on the tasks, OMT will call for extra meetings with the WG to work on specific tasks in half-day or full-day sessions. LTAs for specific common Admin services will be established and maintained by the leading agency. Regular services in other categories will be carried out as planned. 

Relevant progress and results will be timely reported to UNCT.

For cost-benefit analysis, by taking joint efforts in managing procurement and administrative services, a total of USD 50,318 was saved as a result of cost avoidance in 2022. The main reason for cost avoidance is reduced labor costs at different agencies.

In this round’s BOS review, agencies also indicated the estimated cost avoidance in 2023. The estimated amount is about USD 118,521, which will be contributed by the joint efforts in managing procurement and administrative services and the internet services via group negotiation with our service provider, China Unicom."
CIV;Cote d'Ivoire;328;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"2021 marked the beginning of the new United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (CCDD 2021-2025) which articulates the strategic engagement of the UNCT in Côte d’Ivoire to support the country to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the national priorities. The UN RCO and eighteen UN agencies committed to deliver together on the UNSDCF 2021 – 2025 towards achieving the National Development Plan 2021-2025 and the SDGs in Côte d’Ivoire. Nine of the UN agencies are non-resident and thus not participating in BOS and these are: OHCHR, UN Habitat, UNODC. The resident UN agencies including UN RCO and participating in BOS are: FAO, ILO, IOM, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNIDO, UN Women, WFP, WHO, IFAD and UNEP.

In a joint statement, the UN Resident Coordinator and the Ministry of Planning and Development have committed to “a more dynamic, tailored and demand-driven presence, organizing and deploying the UN’s collective human, technical and financial resources in the most effective and efficient manner to improve the living conditions of the “left behind” people in Côte d’Ivoire.”

To implement the Cooperation Framework (CF), the UNCT agreed on the establishment of a governance framework with appropriate coordination mechanisms at the programmatic and operational levels which includes the Operations Management Team (OMT). Delivery of results articulated in the Business Operations Strategy is one of the key deliverables for the OMT.  Based on the lessons learned from the past CF, the UNCT has recommended more alignment of the BOS with the UNSDCF, strong collaboration in data and evidence utilisation, and on joint monitoring visits where quality assurance, risk identification and mitigation can be enhanced, and cost savings achieved in the process. 

The UNCT endorsed the OMT strategic priorities for the period 2021-2023, as follows:

i) achieve the target of 50% of joint offices;
ii) make economies of scale;
iii) reduce transaction costs;
iv) establish common operating procedures.

These priorities for the BOS 2.0 have been selected according to the BOS 2.0 guidelines based on the volume of projects in the country. The projected cost avoidance of BOS Côte d'Ivoire is USD 2.2 M in five years. During the BOS annual review in 2021 and 2022, the UN System in Cote d’Ivoire was able to realize respectively USD 1.1 M and USD 0.47 M cost avoidance. Delivery enhancement will be attained through usage of Long-Term Agreements, mutual recognition, common negotiated contracts with favourable rates due to economies of scale, and utilisation of common rosters for human resources e.g., to be time and cost efficient. Collaboration on cross-cutting issues such as gender, disability inclusion, Greening, Data and digitalisation and staff well-being would also be crucial for an efficient and effective attainment of the set objectives.

The Resident Coordinator of the United Nations System in Côte d'Ivoire is accountable to the Secretary General for the development, implementation and monitoring of BOS 2.0. The UNCT provides overall oversight for the BOS 2.0 process, approval of the final BOS 2.0 and annual reports. The Operations Management Team (chaired by WFP Representative with UNICEF Deputy Representative for Operations as alternate chair) and its working groups are responsible for facilitating the development and implementation of the BOS at country level. The Office of the Resident Coordinator is responsible for supporting the Country Team and the United Nations Resident Coordinator within the framework of BOS 2.0.

As a living document, the BOS 2.0 will be operationalized and implemented by the 3 Strategic Working Groups (Administration and Facilities, Procurement and ICT) to support joint planning, monitoring and reporting of results. The inter-agency activities that will be implemented in the above areas will strive to improve the cost-effectiveness, quality and effectiveness of the Country Team's support to program delivery and operations."
CMR;Cameroon;321;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"2022 marked the beginning of the new Cameroon United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF 2022-2026) which articulates the strategic engagement of the UNCT in Cameroon to support the country to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the national priorities as defined in the National Development Strategy 2030. Twenty-two UNCT members including the World Bank committed, under the Resident Coordinator’s leadership, to engage together with the government in pursuit of the strategic priorities laid out in the UNSDCF 2022-2026 towards achieving the National Development Strategy. Three of the UN agencies are non-resident and thus not participating in BOS and these are: UNEP, UN Habitat, UNODC. The UN resident agencies participating together with the RCO in BOS are: FAO, IFAD, ILO, IOM, ITU, OHCHR, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNECA, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNIDO, UN Women, WFP, WHO, UNOPS.

In their UNSDCF joint statement, the UN Resident Coordinator and the Minister of the Economy, Planning and Regional Development have committed to working together towards achieving the priorities laid in the UNSDCF, aligned to the NDS 2030. Through the UNSDCF, the United Nations system in Cameroon reasserts its commitment to strengthening political dialogue and strategic partnership with the Government of Cameroon to accelerate structural economic transformations. These will result in a diversified, innovative, inclusive, green and competitive economy with increased opportunities for decent employment, human and social capital development, governance for an inclusive society, and environmental resilience. In order to support delivery of the UNSDCF and SDGs, the UNCT and Government agreed to a UNSDCF management structure which includes the Operations Management Team (OMT). Delivery of results articulated in the Business Operations Strategy is one of the key deliverables for the OMT. In order to deliver on the UNSDCF, the OMT and PMT, under the leadership of the RC and UNCT, are strengthening their collaboration in planning and implementation. Delivery enhancement will be attained through a strengthened usage of Long-Term Agreements, common negotiated contracts with favourable rates due to economies of scale and utilisation of common rosters for human resources, harmonised cash transfer disbursement for meetings and payment of partners, better quality of ICT services and harnessing many common administrative services. Collaboration of cross cutting issues on areas such as gender, disability inclusion, Greening, Data and digitalisation and staff well-being will also remain crucial for efficient and effective attainment of the set objectives.

The Cameroon BOS 2.0 has been re-dynamized to be even more pertinent to the operations and reinforce Delivering as One. It aims at: 
- Reducing transaction costs : i) reducing duplication of processes at the agency level by ensuring the provision of services through a single channel rather than decentralizing it to the agency level; ii) reducing transaction costs (time spent in processes) for the United Nations and partners, including the Government, through the harmonization of operational procedures and permanent agreements with service providers; iii) highlighting the United Nations negotiating positions in the procurement of goods and in large quantities.
- Improving the quality of service of providers through joint procurement of large quantities. Increase its bargaining power with service providers.
- Strengthening the links between Programs and Operations:

The results framework adopted for the implementation of the Cameroon 2019-2026 BOS 2.0 is therefore based on the six main service lines:
- Service line 1 - HR: By 2026, the pooling of staff and consultant recruitments will generate a cost avoidance of USD 311,356.
- Service line 2 – Finance Services: By 2023, facilitation of cash disbursements and transfers will generate a cost avoidance of USD 1,347,404.
- Service line 3 - Procurement: By 2023, availability of LTAs and vendor database will be efficient, effective and time saving.
- Service line 4 - ICT: By 2023, better quality of common ICT services; internet connectivity and mobile phone services will generate a cost avoidance of USD  1,302,920.
- Service line 5 - Administration: By 2024, joint administrative services including but not limited to printing, stationary, video production, graphic design, accommodation, environment, travel, catering, security, etc. will generate a cost avoidance of USD  2,338,930.
- Service line 6 - Logistics: By 2023, the United Nations system in Cameroon will benefit from a better quality of common logistics services, freight forwarding, customs clearance and overland cargo transport will generate cost avoidance of USD  578,099.

The total cost avoidance estimated for the period 2019 – 2026 is of USD  5,878,709.

During the BOS Annual Review, the UN System in Cameroon was able to realize USD 3,138,725 cost avoidance."
COD;Democratic Republic of the Congo;330;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the UN RCO and nineteen UN agencies committed to work together and participating in the BOS: FAO, ILO, IOM, UN, UN WOMEN, UNAIDS, UNCDF, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNOPS, UNOCHA, UNHCR, OHCHR, UN HABITAT, WFP, and WHO. The following agencies who are resident and non-resident, does not participate in the BOS: UNCTA, IMF, World Bank, BAD, UNMAS, and FIDA.

The DRC has designed a BOS in support of a more effective programme delivery on the 2030 Agenda. This BOS was developed through the BOS online platform on 01/01/2020. Business Operations Strategy (BOS) 2.0 (2021 - 2023) is developed to coordinate and align its activities for more efficient and effective service delivery including COVID 19 response, thereby mitigating duplication of processes, curtail transaction costs and enhance operational efficiency. As part of the UNSDCF, the BOS 2.0 aims to support maximizing the United Nations (UN) collective advantage in addressing the humanitarian-development-peace nexus and align itself to the 5 Cooperation Framework Outcomes and Partnerships.

Building on the lessons learned on how to improve the Operating as One (OaO) management mechanisms, the BOS 2.0 has been reinvigorated and consists of six outcomes in DRC: Common Procurement Services, Common Logistics Services, Common Finance Services, Common Human Resource Services, Common Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Services and Common Administration including common facility/premises.

The BOS 2.0 has been prepared in a consultative process with the input of various UN Organizations in DRC with the ultimate goal of supporting effective programme delivery, monitoring and evaluation and reporting on common operations. The BOS 2.0, therefore, underlines key priority areas arising from these discussions strengthened by a detailed operational analysis and provides the short and medium-term strategic results that will guide the monitoring and evaluation of operations in Common Procurement, Common Logistics, Common Finance, Common Human Resource, Common Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Common Administration/ Common Premises during the implementation of UN SDCF 2020-2024. It is important to note that implementation of the BOS faced challenges and delays in 2022 which has impacted evaluation of the cost avoid and effectively of the collaboration between agencies.  

Being a living document, the BOS 2.0 will continue to be implemented and operationalized through strategic Working Groups under the guidance of the OMT to support joint planning, monitoring, and reporting for results. Inter-agency activities to be implemented in aforementioned areas will strive to improve cost effectiveness, quality, and efficiency of the UNCTs support to programme delivery and business operations. The OMT has prioritised delivery of the SG’s efficiency agenda through implementation of BOS, Common Back Office and Common Premises. Implementation of the BOS 2.0 was expected to result in a net cost avoidance of USD 6.121.661 over a 5-year period. UNCT in DRC was able to realize USD 2,568.511 cost avoidance during the BOS annual review in 2021. This is to be achieved through collaboration in implementation of 6 common services which are:

-       Human Resources
-       Financial Services
-       Procurement Services
-       ICT Services
-       Administration Services and including Common Facilities/Premises
-       Logistics Services  

Learning from the challenges and hurdles of 2022, the BOS country team will continue to work offline and report during the next evaluation cycle. Further, in the year 2022, the OMT aims to effectively support delivery on all the 17 SDGs thus the OMT has prioritised high impact indicators that support delivery of SDGs expected results. Some of the high impact indicators identified include Inclusion agenda (Disability, Gender equality and women’s empowerment and Youth), Greening initiative, Innovation: Data and digitalisation.

Through the inclusion agenda, the OMT will support delivery of results for SDG5 on Gender Equality for example through ensuring gender balance Human Resources and gendered procurement; SDG 10 Reduced Inequalities through Implementation of practices that encourage inclusion of all irrespective of gender and disability. The OMT has also prioritised delivery of SDGs through implementation of high impact indicators greater adoption and use of improved technologies such as internet connectivity and VSAT services and mobile phone services. BOS2.0 in DRC will support SDG3, SDG5, SDG10 and SDG17 through the implementation of Gender Parity, Staff Training and Mapping of Accessible (Disability & Inclusion) venues.

In total, 21 common services for HR 7, 3 for Finance, 2 for Procurement, 2 for ICT, 5 for Administration, and 2 for Logistics were implemented in 2022. Among these common services, 12 of them are CBA type which provided both quality improvement and cost avoidance and the remaining common services focused only on quality improvement. The cost avoidance realized by implementing 12 CBA-type common services stands at USD 8.6 million. In the previous time, the data obtained from different secretariat agencies were consolidated under the UN but for this year it was disaggregated among UNS-OCHA, UNS-OHCHR, UNS-UN HABITAT UNS-DSS and UNS-RCOs. A key focus for the OMT in 2022 was the implementation of the UN Disability Inclusion as well as Gender Parity agendas. In this connection, Common Logistics and Procurement Working Group put the inclusion of Disability Inclusion as well as Gender Parity agendas in a solicitation document as mandatory criteria.

In 2023, the OMT has agreed to reinvigorate the OMT and OMT Working Groups and implementation of the BOS toward achieving further cost and quality efficiency targets as set for the UN DRC BOS Strategy. The implementation will continue to be monitored on a regular basis under the overall guidance of the UNCT. "
COG;Congo;326;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The United Nations in the Republic of Congo committed to implement the Business Operation Strategy(BOS) which was developed in 2012 by the UNDG Business Operation Working Group. The BOS, which is one of five key priorities in the UNSGs reform agenda, is the backbone of the “Operating as One” pillar of the standard Operating Procedure for Delivering as One.

Therefore, since the implementation of BOS, the existing collaboration between UN agencies has been accelerated by improving the quality and the access to service with significant elimination on duplicating of process and increasing possibilities of economic scales.

The current BOS includes eight (8) common cost avoidance services, where administrative services occupy a large share with six (06) common services. The total cost avoidance for the next three years is estimated at USD 1.11 m, with a cost/benefit ratio of 14.6%. This represents an appreciable level of cost avoidance for the UN entities which will be mostly used in the implementation of programme.

In 2022, it is noted that the total gain from the common service 1,439,141 USD compared the estimation of 501,749 USD, of which 63.76% is from printing service of common administration.  The highest benefit ratios are observed in Printing  services 63.76 % ($ USD 917,588), travel service 15.77 % ($ USD 226,927) and catering service 12.36 % ($ USD 177,938).

This indeed reduced workload of UN staff which allows to enhance its qualitative programme results. As regards the improvement of quality services, the utilization of common benchmarks, indicators, terms of reference and monitoring of services will greatly enhance the control on services being provided.

The risks for the implementation of the BOS have been identified, as well as the assumptions that will enable the UN entities to achieve the set results. The implementation plan will pave the way for a structured approach in the monitoring of the BOS and support the achievement of the objectives. The introduction of the BOS will create synergies between UN entities’, and it is expected that this will create more avenues of cooperation and instrumental in transitioning to Common Business Operations.

As of February 2023, the BOS Annual Review was initiated by the OMT. This included a comprehensive review of participating agencies, OMT/UNCT/BOS members, the opportunity analysis, update of activities completing and planned in 2022 and a review of the planning framework. The UNCT was briefed on the BOS progress during the UNCT meeting on monthly basis and a discussion took place on additional service lines to be added during 2023. 

It was agreed jointly to implement four new services. Those new services will support a pragmatic decision-making process based on recommended services and an applicability to the country context. So far two ICT services and two vendor database service will be included. 

Finally, existing collaboration was extended where positive user feedback was received. Additional areas for collaboration were identified in collaboration with the regional BOS and included in the work plan of the Working Groups. As a result, it is likely that the banking service provider will be assessed to provide satisfactory services to all and not just some agencies. 

All the selected services and OMT activities are reported on the OMT Annual Work Plan. "
COL;Colombia;325;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"For the 2022 annual review, a validation exercise was carried out on the 8 common services prioritized by the OMT and approved by the UNCT last year. These 8 common services are distributed into the platform in the below 4 service lines.

Common HR Services
1-LTA for medical services and dispensary.
2-Gender Parity

Common Procurement Services
3- Central Database for LTA´s.

Common ICT Services
4-LTA for internet / MPLS services.

Common Administration Services and Including Common Facilities/Premises
5-LTA for cleaning services.
6-LTA for travel services.
7-LTA for conference and event management.
8- Establishment of Common Premises

For the above-mentioned initiatives, information was updated from the CBAs of 11 Agencies: UNDP, FAO, UNODC, UN WOMEN, UNFPA, UNHCR, OHCHR, UNMAS (UNOPS), UN HABITAT, UNICEF and UNV.

A new Common HR Service was uploaded to the platform for this annual review; PSEA - Prevention of Sexual Explotation and Abuse, action Plan aligned with guidelines  the office of the Special Coordinator on improving the United Nations response to sexual exploitation and abuse (OSCSEA): cost sharing to fund interagency initiatives to promote PSEA standards with the leadership of an interagency PSEA coordinator whose position has been funded since 2020 by UN entities members of the PSEA Task Force.

For the Cleaning Services and Internet initiatives, a significant number of Agencies were unable to continue the use of LTAs, most of them arguing that they had signed their own contracts that started prior to these two initiatives, which are still in force. A new opportunity analysis will be made to verify if it is necessary to manage new LTA's that meet the needs of the Agencies that have disengaged.

When designed, the BOS in Colombia was expecting a total cost avoidance for five years of USD$ 1,003,154 (adjustment to CPI and TRM). Based on current CBA figures, we estimate that close to 100% of the cost-avoidance targets have been met for the first four years of implementation. Using these new figures and tracking agency participation, the OMT has reviewed targets to USD$ 1,262,859 for the five years period.

Based on current CBA figures, close to 70% of the cost-avoidance targets have been met for the first four years of implementation.

The UNCT will look to revamp its BOS in 2023. Based on opportunities identified by assessing changes in programing and operational contexts compared to years prior, the UNCT will look to incorporate new BOS initiatives. For instance, the pandemic imposed new hybrid work models (e.g. less travel more ICT and internet services used) to which BOS initiatives now have to be adapted. The programing and operational contexts have also changed (e.g. migrant and refugee flows from Venezuela have increased and decreased, shifting programing needs and demand for operational capacity).

Further, based on the ongoing review, the UNCT hopes to renew efforts, widen the use of LTAs in the current BOS strategy (e.g. an average of six agencies are using each of the LTAs currently in place) and increase the number of agencies that are part of the BOS. The UNCT will review obstacles encountered by entities in the use LTAs and make recommendations on how to surmount them.

Clarification notes related to information uploaded in the platform:
 - UNMAS´s CBAs were uploaded as UNOPS in the BOS platform, since UNMAS wasn't available in the platform by the time the information was uploaded."
COM;Comoros;301;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"L’Equipe pays des Nations Unies (UNCT) en Union des Comores, ensemble avec le Gouvernement comorien, les autres acteurs nationaux du développement et les partenaires au développement, viennent d’élaborer un nouveau Cadre de coopération des Nations Unies pour le développement durable (UNSDCF) du pays, couvrant la période 2022 - 2026. L'UNSDCF représente l'offre collective du système des Nations Unies pour soutenir la mise en œuvre du Plan Comores Emergent (PCE) durant la période de référence du Cadre de coopération et dans la perspective de l’atteinte des Objectifs de développement durable (ODD). En vue d’optimiser les conditions d’une mise en œuvre réussie de l’UNSDCF, l’UNCT a élaboré la Stratégie des opérations commerciales (BOS) 2.0 (2021 - 2025) afin de soutenir ses activités par une prestation de services plus efficace et plus efficiente, prenant en compte le contexte de l’actuelle pandémie COVID-19 et au-delà, sachant les transformations prévisibles dans l’environnement commerciale post-COVID-19. Le but étant d'atténuer la duplication des processus, de réduire les coûts de transaction et d'améliorer l'efficacité opérationnelle.

La stratégie des opérations commerciales (BOS) est un cadre axé sur les résultats qui se concentre sur les opérations commerciales conjointes dans le but d'éliminer les doubles emplois, de tirer parti du pouvoir de négociation commun des Nations Unies et de maximiser les économies d'échelle. La BOS 2.0 (2021-2025) a été développée par la plateforme en ligne BOS 2.0 courant 2020 pour son opérationnalisation à partir de janvier 2021. Elle passera par une phase de suivi annuel et doit être révisée le 30 novembre 2021. La BOS se concentre sur les services communs qui sont mis en œuvre conjointement ou fournis par une entité des Nations Unies au nom d'une ou plusieurs autres entités des Nations Unies. Des services communs pour une collaboration future ont été identifiés dans les domaines des Services administratifs , Services financiers, Services des ressources humaines, Services d’approvisionnement . Les entités des Nations Unies participant à la BOS 2.0 pour la période 2021-2025 aux Comores, à savoir, le Bureau du Coordinateur Résident (BCR), le PNUD, l’UNFPA, l’UNICEF, l’OMS, la FAO, l’OIM, l’UNDSS, la Banque Mondiale et le FMI sont responsables devant le Secrétaire Général de l'élaboration, de la mise en œuvre, du suivi et de l'établissement de rapports concernant la BOS 2.0 et des mesures prises en vue d'un Back Office Commun (CBO). L'Equipe de pays des Nations Unies assure la supervision générale du processus de BOS 2.0, l'approbation des organisations des Nations Unies et des ressources communes nécessaires, l'approbation de la version finale de la BOS 2.0 et l'établissement de rapports annuels. L'équipe de gestion des opérations, OMT (présidée par le PNUD comme agence lead de l’OMT pour l’année 2020) et ses organes subsidiaires sont chargés de faciliter l'élaboration et la mise en œuvre de la BOS au niveau des pays. Le Bureau de la coordination des activités de développement des Nations Unies (BCAD-ONU/UN DCO) est responsable de l'orientation et du soutien à l'Equipe de pays des Nations Unies en ce qui concerne la BOS 2.0. S'appuyant sur les enseignements tirés sur la manière d'améliorer les mécanismes de gestion de l’OMT, la BOS 2.0 (2021 - 2025) a été revigorée et comprend trois domaines de résultat aux Comores:

Services administratifs communs et y compris les installations: Achat d’équipement de sécurité ; Services de sécurité composés commun ; Services de sécurité externalisés ; Entretien du jardin ; Services d’hébergement (externalisés) ; Services de nettoyage ; Services de chauffage, de ventilation et de climatisation ; Signalisation du Bâtiment ; Services de maintenances des groupes Electrogènes ; Services de voyage.

Services financiers communs : Services bancaires et frais bancaires ; Macro-évaluation ; Micro-évaluation.

Services communs des ressources humaines: Achat de fourniture d’EPI ; Fourniture d’équipement médiale.

La nouvelle configuration de la BOS 2.0 est également soutenue par une plateforme en ligne qui guide l'équipe de gestion des opérations (OMT) afin de réduire davantage la complexité et les coûts de transaction pour le développement de la BOS et de débloquer de nouvelles opportunités pour l'OMT, l'UNCT pour suivre, analyser et faire rapport sur l'impact de la BOS, à la fois du point de vue de la réduction des coûts et de l'amélioration de la qualité.

La BOS 2.0 (2021 - 2025) a été préparée dans le cadre d'un processus hautement consultatif avec la contribution de diverses organisations des Nations Unies aux Comores, dans le but ultime de soutenir l'exécution efficace des programmes, le suivi et l'évaluation et l'établissement de rapports sur les opérations communes. Des consultations avec l'OMT, ses groupes de travail techniques et le team leader du Bureau du Coordonnateur Résident au sein des différentes organisations des Nations Unies ont été entreprises pour calibrer le niveau de performance en ce qui concerne leurs fonctions opérationnelles clés. Le BOS 2.0 souligne donc les domaines prioritaires clés issus de ces discussions, renforcés par une analyse opérationnelle détaillée, et fournit les résultats stratégiques à court et moyen terme qui guideront le suivi et l'évaluation des opérations dans les trois (3) services communs susmentionnés pendant la mise en œuvre du Cadre de coopération pour le développement durable (UNSDCF) 2022 - 2026 aux Comores.

Étant un document évolutif, la BOS 2.0 (2021 - 2025) sera mise en œuvre et rendue opérationnelle par le biais de cinq (5) groupes de travail stratégiques de l'OMT (administration commune, finances communes et HACT, TIC communes, ressources humaines communes et achat communs) sous la direction de l'OMT afin de soutenir la planification, le suivi et l'établissement de rapports communs sur les résultats. Les activités inter-institutions à mettre en œuvre dans les domaines susmentionnés s'efforceront d'améliorer la rentabilité, la qualité et l'efficacité du soutien de l'équipe de pays des Nations Unies à l'exécution des programmes et aux opérations commerciales. La mise en œuvre de la BOS 2.0 devrait permettre d'éviter des coûts nets de USD 301,991.00 grâce à l'harmonisation des opérations commerciales sur la période de cinq ans allant de 2021 à 2025.

En outre, l'équipe de pays des Nations Unies aux Comores a intégré dans la BOS 2.0 (2021 - 2025) l'innovation, la durabilité environnementale et d'autres éléments à l'appui de la réalisation des ODD."
CPV;Cabo Verde;319;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The Cabo Verde’s Business Operations Strategy (BOS) represents an important step in the process of strengthening the coherence and harmonization of the interventions of UN agencies, funds, programs, for the strengthening of the strategic focus, coordination, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of its business operations. 

Cabo Verde has the particularity and specificity of having a Joint Office, by the fact that Cabo Verde became the first pilot Joint Office (JO) of the Ex-Com agencies (UNDP, UNICEF, UNFPA and WFP) on 1 January 2006, as the major step of UN reform towards the harmonization and simplification of UN activities in small countries.

The Joint Office model consists of a single UN Office of the participating Agencies, led by one representative who equally represents all the participating agencies. The reason for its establishment was that in countries where the United Nations System presence is very small, the combined representation, staffing and support costs of United Nations agencies are often, according to the Secretary-General “excessive in proportion to their small programme budgets.

The Joint Office model was designed to improve the effectiveness of the United Nations in such countries by rationalizing representation and improving the ratio of programme to support costs.  

The Joint Office is itself an example of collaboration since 2006.

The BOS Cabo Verde now revised, covers the period 2020-2022 and aims the harmonizing and simplifying different operational services in the areas of Procurement, Common Premises, and Logistics; Information & Communication Technology (ICT); Finance, and Human Resources.

Cabo Verde has also a UN House in Praia built in 1995, hosting since then the Resident Agencies UNDP, UNICEF and UNFPA, WHO and FAO joined in 2012. The UN House host also Non-resident Agencies such as UNODC, UNIDO, OIM, ILO, UNHABITAT, UNOPS GEF/Small Grants. With the UNDS Reform in 2019, and subsequent De-liking process, the UN House also hosts the UN Resident Coordinator Office.  In 2020, the World Bank joined the UN House as tenant.

Since 1995 some services are already in common such as Security, Cleaning, Maintenance Air conditioning, Generator and Elevator, Receptionist and UN Clinic. However, this exercise allowed the OMT and WG’s to identify some additional areas of collaboration for the harmonization and simplification.

The BOS for Cabo Verde introduces a results-based and innovative solutions in business operations based on cost-benefit analysis and broad consultations among the agencies in the country.

Its implementation foresees to generate gains in staff working hours as well as savings and aims to increase the quality of operational services in the next year, whose implementation can not only bring advantages but also be considered an asset in the BOS implementation and to respond in a collective way to corporate policies such as  Gender Parity, Green Office, PSEA, UN activities (UN Cares & UN Day), Staff welfare spaces, Green IT ...)

In total Cabo Verde commits to strengthen 28 common services under four Common Service lines especially the potential high yielding services being, establishment of common, reflected in the CBA summary as follows:

Projected costs 2,493,748 USD, with Projected future costs 1,462,758 USD representing a Projected cost avoidance of 1,030,990 USD. Highest impact services are HACT Audit, Internet Connectivity ,  Security Services and Cleaning Services.

It focuses on a practical and realistic consolidation of services among the agencies to achieve better results and improved efficiencies whilst reducing the burden on the agencies’ personnel .

By promoting the collaborative work, the BOS seeks to minimize transaction costs and to achieve cost savings on internal and external sourced goods and services. The review of the BOS was built on lessons learned and on the established mechanisms for a joint approach to work as one UN.

Ana Graça, the Resident Coordinator, is accountable to the Secretary-General for the development, implementation, monitoring and reporting of the BOS and steps towards a common back office.

The UNCT provides overall oversight of the BOS process, approval and release of necessary agency and joint resources, sign off the final BOS and annual reporting.

The Operations Management Team and its subsidiary bodies are responsible to facilitate development and implementation of the BOS at the country level with the support from DCO regional office

At the implementation level, it is the responsibility of the Managing Agency of each common service to achieve the yearly planned targets in close coordination and collaboration of the designated working group.

The Cabo Verde UNCT recognizes that the quality of the support to the business operations is critical for programme delivery and in-country office operations."
CRI;Costa Rica;327;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"El BOS en Costa Rica fue firmado en julio de 2019, inicialmente el enfoque principal de las acciones se centró en 4 áreas principalmente: Recursos Humanos, Finanzas, ICT y Common Premises (Administration).  En la revisión de 2022 se enfocaron los esfuerzos en expandir las acciones a servicios como logística, eventos, servicios de diseño, entre otros.  También se buscó involucrar a más agencias en las acciones que ya se desarrollan, pero a la vez proponer nuevos servicios que puedan abarcar agencias que actualmente tienen bajo involucramiento en el BOS.

Los siguientes son servicios comunes existentes al momento de la firma del BOS y que ya se encuentran operando de manera estable entre las agencias involucradas:
1.    - Accessibility for UN Common Premises
2.     - Building maintenance services (outsourced)
3.     - Cleaning Services
4.     - Management of common premises
5.    - Office space and accomodation
6.     - Parking service
7.     - Pest control services
8.     - Reception services

Para el periodo de 2022 se propusieron nuevas acciones para expandir los servicios, incluyendo acciones en las siguientes áreas:
- Harmonised customs clearance
- Overland cargo transport
- Storage and warehouse management services
- Conference and event management
- Garbage Collection Services
- Graphic Design services
- Video production / Feature Stories 
- Servicios relacionados con Disability Inclusion
- Gender Responsive Procurement Sourcing  
- Staff training (mentoring)

Hasta la fecha se han logrado un cost avoidance de US$27K, los cuales se espera aumentar en el presente año.  Para el periodo de 2022 se enfocaron esfuerzsos en servicios sin CBA, pero para futuros periodos se espera aumentar el cost avoidance progresivamente con la implementación de los servicios planeados para el año en curso.

Durante la revisión en 2023 se enfocaron esfuerzos en verificar la información contenida en el CBA y reportar los resultados para el periodo anterior.  Fueron identificados grandes avances en las acciones relacionadas con Dispacidad y Género, que cabe restaltar como los principales resultados para el año anterior.  Se enfrentaron retos pues al enfocar esfuerzos en estas dos áreas se debieron ajustar las fechas meta para otros procesos relacionados con aspectos más administrativos, los cuales se estarán cubriendo a más cabalidad durante el 2023.  Por esta misma razón en esta revisión no se están proponiendo servicios nuevos, para focalizar esfuerzos en desarrollar los que ya tenemos planteados y avanzar más en el nuevo periodo."
CUB;Cuba;329;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The UNCT Cuba developed its first business operation strategy (BOS) 2021-2026 looking for a set of efficient and optimized common services that can have a direct impact in both programme delivery and daily operations. This BOS embraces the UN reform with a pragmatic vision responding to the Cuban reality and programmatic needs as outlined in the UNSDCF. The impact of COVID-19, the economic adjustments and reforms initiated in early 2021 in the country, and the restrictions arising from the US embargo, have challenged existing business models and provided an opportunity to advance “alternative thinking” for operational mechanisms to contribute to the proposed results of the ongoing Cooperation Framework 2020-2024.

With this as a basis, the Cuba BOS looks for efficiency through: mitigating duplication of processes; simplifying business practices to save time invested; leveraging resources; creating efficiency in management of offices with the use of technology and lessons learnt from COVID-19 working & business modalities; curtailing transactional costs; and using a renewed set of working principles among staff. The big message in the BOS is neither increasing nor favoring fragmented processes but rather transforming them. 

As a result, Cuba BOS is expected to achieve a cost avoidance of 1.600K USD (5%) through 34 transformed common processes by 2026. The main principles in the implementation exercise will be: fostering the use of mutual recognition; promoting a knowledge and info sharing platform across the OMT; replicating good practices & trendy businesses across UN operations; and favoring flexibility and complementarity among service lines and agency participation. Furthermore, the current BOS seeks to set the basis for the global initiative on Common Premises and the establishment of a Common Back Office, as a seeding strategy in the UN efficiency agenda.

The BOS has been initiated on July 1st, 2021 and is monitored on annual basis. Common services for future collaboration have been identified in the areas of Administration, Finance, Human Resources, Information & Technology, Logistics and Procurement. The current strategy is bringing together the Office of the RCO and 11 UN entities with physical presence in the country (FAO, IOM, UNESCO, UNDP, UNFPA, UNHABITAT, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNIDO, WHO, WFP). Moreover, 11 non-resident agencies will benefit as well from the common services identified in support of the 2030 agenda implementation.
 
Among the BOS service lines, Administration accounts for 72% of the expected total cost avoidance with a repositioning of common premises standards, reinforcement of business continuity, and efficiency in office management considering foreseen business models. Such a weight in the cost avoidance structure is perfectly aligned to country typology for Cuba. Following the challenges in the national context, the Finance pillar will be mainly dealing with banking services given the monetary reform and economic transforming processes launched by the local authorities. Furthermore, HACT micro-assessments are included in this area using a new approach for service provider. On the other hand, Procurement and Logistics are highly related and dependable from one each other. These will tackle clearing mechanisms with national agents for supply imports (considering the risk involved and significant volume of import processes) and joint procurement and acquisition processes for emergency purposes. Additionally, Information and Technology is directly linked to business continuity and is expected to yield qualitive improvements rather than cost avoidance, considering challenges faced in the country with connectivity and related services. Lastly, Human Resources are mainly focused on staff wellbeing given COVID-19 context and new economic reforms implemented in the country. This service line is also incorporating topics directly impacting the SDGs such as PSEA, youth employment, gender and inclusive approach for recruitment processes. 
 
Due to the level of complexity in working arrangements as well as the challenges faced locally, the services time-line for the implementation was carefully reviewed and updated. As a result, common services which were feasible to kick off where planned and carried out such us: those related to the staff wellbeing (Agreements with clinics, procurement of PPE supplies and the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse), local payroll processing, HACT management, banking service as well as those related to the premise management (Joint Business Continuity Plan and management of common services). On the other hand, joint procurement processes, stationery, IT procurement, freight forwarding, travel and conference management are set to be initiated during 2022.
 
As per the Annual Review, as at March 31st, 2023, the BOS, at all its stages, was comprehensively assessed in a joint-effort with all UN Agencies involved. The BOS Reviewed, shows the relevant changes and reflect properly the reality of the context which the Agencies operate in. The BOS aims at integrate all feasible work that Agencies can perform together, taking into account the challenges and limitations present in the field, and offer a set of activities and opportunities that can be materialized and derived into an optimizations of the resources and maximization of benefits within the UN System in Cuba. When compared with the last-year revision, the macroeconomic environment remains as challenging as it was, especially in terms of the impact on the operations as a consequence of a rising inflation, which impacts at several spheres: from the cost of living to the budget of the Agencies, and as a result on the programme implementation. The  Furthermore, an as for the period between July 1st, 2021 and March 31st, 2023, a cost avoidance of USD 330K has been achieved as a result of the implementation of the above-mentioned common services. Moreover, it should be highlighted that besides the on-going implementation, a special consideration was given to those common services and indicators linked to the Sustainable Development Goals, for instance Gender Parity and Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse has been closely assessed and an implementation roadmap has been established.
 
Consultations within OMT were undertaken to calibrate performance levels and implementation timelines in identified operations. These discussions provided an operational assessment as set out in the Opportunity Analysis and in the Planning Framework. Estimated budget for implementation is estimated in 44.8k USD. It is mainly focusing in activities related to BCP, management of common premises, HH.RR. surveys, PPE supplies and HACT. Most of financial requirements are already included in UN entities budgets. Consequently, the budget gap is around 13% and aims to address actions related to common premises realignment and joint BCP basic needs.


Main threats for success were identified and grouped into different categories such as contextual, institutional behavior, operational and programmatic. The impact of context elements such as COVID-19, natural disasters, economic crisis, inflation, the creation of new legal actors and frameworks, and US embargo, among others, may severely reduce expected goals from this BOS. Other main institutional factors such as lack of commitment from UN entities, silos in UN entities, not reporting on time and business as usual mindset in the implementation, are considered to possibly hamper operational success of the strategy. Furthermore, operational factors that may negatively influence the implementation of BOS are related to the high level of scarcity in markets, price increase on the oil, and limited providers the UN Cuba can work with, a high dependency on import process for supply procurement, and complex national mechanisms for importation of programme supplies, among others. From the programmatic scope, main threats identified were related to a lack programmatic planning which increases footprint of operational support and transactional costs.
 
Due to the specific context of Cuba, it is mandatory to give special consideration to the consequences of the US Embargo. The prohibition on the procurement of technological inputs that contain more than 10 per cent of U.S. components remains in force. Similarly, other restrictive measures established by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in the U.S. Department of Commerce under the U.S. embargo against Cuba are maintained, imposing prohibitions and regulatory and licensing requirements on the import, export and re-export of goods and technology of U.S. origin to the island. The intensification of these regulatory and licensing requirements has a significant impact on procurements by the United Nations system, complicating and delaying procurement processes and severely restricting the use of the goods and technology procured by end-users. In general terms, procurement processes are also hampered by the increasing time spent on needs analysis, market research and the arrival of goods and services in the country; the significant reduction in the number of interested suppliers who are able to make an offer; the shortage of and difficult access to raw materials for the procurement and provision of services at the local level; and the increase in delivery times, costs associated with freight and insurance, as well as guarantees and maintenance.


In order to implement the BOS, the OMT agrees that main internal factors to ensure success are: full support from UNCT; keeping monthly meetings and reporting to UNCT on advancements, issues, and bottlenecks; strong internal control system from UN entities to allow process sharing; and that outcomes and recommendations from reviews are implemented by UN entities.


It is worth mentioning that the BOS only reflects common services and does not replace any UN entity’s individual operational plan. As a living strategy, the BOS is rather elastic and flexible to adjust operational requirements as deemed necessary in the path to sustainable development.

DJI;Djibouti;331;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Sommaire de la Stratégie relative aux activités de gestion et d’appui (BOS 2.0, 2021 – 2023)

Le Système des Nations Unies en République de Djibouti s’engage résolument à aligner son action sur les priorités, incluant les mesures covid-19, identifiées par le gouvernement dans le cadre du nouveau Plan National de Développement, ceci en vue d’harmoniser son format avec les directives pour un nouveau cadre de coopération pour le développement durable (CCDD/UNSDCF), issu de la Réforme des Nations Unies, que la République de Djibouti soutient. Pour ce faire, l’Équipe pays des Nations Unies à Djibouti a élaboré, conformément à la Réforme des processus opérationnels prônée par le Système des Nations Unies, la Stratégie relatives aux activités de gestion et d’appui (BOS 2.0, 2021 - 2023) pour coordonner et aligner ses activités en vue d’une prestation de services plus efficace et efficiente dans le soutien au gouvernement, y compris la réponse covid-19, atténuant ainsi le double emploi des processus, réduisant les coûts de transaction et améliorant l’efficacité opérationnelle. Dans le cadre de l’UNDAF/UNSDCF, le BOS 2.0 de Djibouti vise à soutenir la maximisation de l’avantage collectif des Nations Unies (ONU) pour s’attaquer au lien humanitaire-développement-paix et s’aligner sur les 4 résultats et partenariats du Cadre de coopération, à savoir le peuple, la paix, la prospérité et la planète.

La Stratégie relative aux activités de gestion et d’appui (BOS 2.0, 2021 - 2023) est un cadre axé sur les résultats qui met l’accent sur les opérations commerciales conjointes dans le but d’éliminer les doubles emplois, de tirer parti du pouvoir commun de négociation de l’ONU et de maximiser les économies d’échelle. Le BOS 2.0 se concentre sur les services communs qui sont mis en œuvre conjointement ou fournis par une entité des Nations Unies au nom d’une ou plusieurs autres entités des Nations Unies. Des services communs pour la collaboration future ont été identifiés dans les domaines des services d’administration, de finances, des ressources humaines, des technologies de l’information et des communications (TIC), de la logistique et  de l’approvisionnement. Les Organisations des Nations Unies suivantes participent au BOS 2.0 (2021-2023) de Djibouti : FAO, l’OIT, l’OIM, l’UNC, le PNUD, le FNUAP, l’UNHCR, l’UNICEF, l’ONUDI, l’ONUSIDA, le PAM, et l’OMS. 

Le Coordonnateur Résident du Système des Nations Unies en République de Djibouti est responsable devant le Secrétaire général du développement, de la mise en œuvre, du suivi et de la communication du BOS 2.0 et des étapes vers un back office commun (CBO). L’UNCT assure la surveillance globale du processus BOS 2.0, l’approbation et la libération des organisations des Nations Unies et des ressources conjointes nécessaires, l’approbation du BOS 2.0 final et des rapports annuels. L’équipe de gestion des opérations (présidée par Emma Ngouan-Anoh et Tanja Paficico, respectivement Représentantes du PNUD et de l'OM) et ses groupes de travail sont chargés de faciliter le développement et la mise en œuvre du BOS au niveau national. Le Bureau de la Coordination du Développement (DCO) est chargé de soutenir l’Equipe pays et le Coordonnateur Résident des Nations Unies dans le cadre du BOS 2.0.  

S’inspirant des leçons apprises sur la façon d’améliorer les mécanismes de gestion de l’exploitation en tant qu’entité fonctionnant comme une (OaO), le BOS 2.0 (2021 - 2023) a été revigoré et consiste à l’atteinte de six résultats à Djibouti : la logistique et l’approvisionnement commun, la finance commune, les ressources humaines communes, les technologies communes de l’information et des communications (TIC), les achats et l’administration commune. La nouvelle itération du BOS est également soutenue par une plate-forme en ligne qui guide l’équipe de gestion des opérations (OMT) afin de réduire davantage la complexité et les coûts de transaction pour le développement du BOS et de débloquer de nouvelles opportunités pour l’OMT, l’UNCT et la direction régionale et mondiale pour surveiller, analyser et rendre compte de l’impact du BOS, tant du point de vue de la réduction des coûts que de l’amélioration de la qualité.

Le BOS 2.0 (2021 - 2023), premier de sa génération à Djibouti, a été préparé dans le cadre d’un processus hautement consultatif avec l’apport de diverses agences des Nations Unies à Djibouti dans le but ultime de soutenir la mise en œuvre, le suivi et l’évaluation efficaces des programmes et de rendre compte des opérations communes. Des consultations avec l’OMT, ses membres des groupes de travail techniques issus des différentes agences des Nations Unies ont été entreprises pour calibrer le niveau de performance en ce qui concerne leurs fonctions opérationnelles clés. Le BOS 2.0 souligne donc les principaux domaines prioritaires découlant de ces discussions renforcées par une analyse opérationnelle détaillée et fournit les résultats stratégiques l’année en cours qui guideront le suivi et l’évaluation des opérations dans six (6) services communs mentionnés ci-dessus lors de la mise en œuvre du PNUAD/UNSDCF de Djibouti 2021-2024, qui vient de bénéficier d’une extension jusqu’en 2024 pour s’aligner sur les plans nationaux.

En tant que document vivant, le BOS 2.0 (2021 - 2023) sera opérationnalisé et mis en œuvre par les six (6) groupes de travail stratégiques de l’OMT (Administration commune, Approvisionnement et logistique commun, Finances communes et HACT, TIC communes, les achats et les Ressources humaines communes) sous la direction de l’OMT pour soutenir la planification, le suivi et la communication conjoints des résultats. Les activités inter-agences qui seront mises en œuvre dans les domaines susmentionnés s’efforceront d’améliorer la rentabilité, la qualité et l’efficacité du soutien de l’Equipe pays à la prestation des programmes et aux opérations commerciales. La mise en œuvre du BOS 2.0 a permit d’éviter des coûts nets de USD 700,725 USD grâce à l’harmonisation des opérations commerciales au cours de l'année à 2022. Ces économies devraient permettre de réinjecter les fonds dans les programmes de coopération avec le gouvernement de Djibouti pour un plus grand impact pour les populations cibles. L’analyse coûts-avantages montre spécifiquement que les économies monétaires seront de l'ordre de 1,924,641 USD . Il est escompté que les Services communs des ICT produisent des améliorations qualitatives plutôt que de l’évitement des coûts. En outre, l’UNCT à Djibouti s’est efforcée d’intégrer la parité du genre et l’inclusion des handicaps dans les pratiques des Ressources humaines et d’autres éléments à l’appui des ODD dans le BOS 2.0 (2021 - 2023).

DOM;Dominican Republic;332;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"During 2022, due to different unforeseen reasons (Post pandemic) collaborating agencies could not establish the number of LTAs projected. Under finance services HACT LTA was completed, including HACT audit and Micro-assessment.

Currently we have reviewed implementation dates and we have taken a more realistic approach towards the LTAs processes which are intended to start mid-2023 and 2024. These LTAs services include catering services, conference and events management, transport services and travel services.

Presently, participating agencies have included a new service under administrative common category (transportation services). The other services include and distribute as follows: Human Resources Services (5), Financial Services (3), Administration Services (5) and Logistics Services (1). The total is therefore 14 categories of services.

Regarding the negotiation of health service agreements with an important local provider, we are going to conduct meetings and proceed negotiations including with a very recognized hospital and pharmacy.  The lactation room will be re- painted and further improved.

Likewise, in administrative services, the hiring of a) Catering Services, b) Conference and Event Services, as well as Travel services are in process and should be completed by the end of 2023.

The OMT and the UNCT in the Dominican Republic are committed to working together collaboratively during 2023 to implement this plan and achieve greater efficiency and cost savings."
DZA;Algeria;304;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Algeria joined the United Nations (UN) on October 8, 1962. Since the mid-1960s, United Nations agencies have cooperated with the government to support national priorities through strategic partnerships that foster development economically and socially sustainable.

A total of 17 United Nations agencies, funds and programs are present in the country (CLCPRO, ILO, IOM, FAO, UNIDO, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNFPA, UNIC, UNICEF, UNICRI, UNHCR, WFP, WHO, WIPO, UNODC, UNDSS, UNOPS) and Algeria also cooperates with 10 non-resident agencies (UHABITAT, UNESCO, UNCTAD, IAEA, UNITAR, ITU, IFAD, UNWTO, UN WOMEN, UNEP). Among the resident agencies, the United Nations system employs just over 230 national staff and 49 international staff.

Algeria is the largest country in Africa and the Arab world. It made significant progress towards achieving all SDGs, with particularly remarkable results in health and education. Algeria's human development index for 2019 (HDR 2020) is 0.748, which places the country at 91st out of 189 countries and territories.  

Algeria and the UN are currently approaching the end of the programmatic cycle under the Strategic Cooperation Framework (CdCS) 2019-2021, an extension of the CdCS 2016-2020 adopted to account for the evolution of the Algerian context since the political transition that the country experienced under the impetus of the “hirak” popular movement in 2019.

The UNCT in Algeria is currently engaged in the formulation process of the next Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (CCDD 2023-2027), based on a common analysis of development issues, challenges and opportunities (CCA for Common Country Analysis). With its signature expected in May 2022, the CCDD 2023-2027 will be aligned with the Government's vision for a new Algeria, articulated through the Government's Action Plan for 2020-2024 and the new Algerian Constitution adopted in January 2021. The UNS is also reviewing issues of operational efficiency while designing relevant programs in relation to the ambitious development objectives of the country. In UN General Assembly resolution 72/279, member states set the goal for all UN country teams to have a quality Business Operations Strategy (BOS) in place by 2021, which translated into 131 BOS developed globally.

The BOS is an essential instrument to strengthen collaboration in United Nations support services at country level and improve cost efficiency, reduce duplication, and reduce administrative costs and transactions. Therefore, following the resolution of the GA, taking into account the existing capacities, challenges and opportunities presented by the Algerian context, the UN Operation Management Team (OMT) in Algeria has developed, under the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinator, a BOS 2021-2023, with the objective of updating the strategy post Covid-19, when ‘normal’ operations resume.

The programme delivery of the UN for 2021 summed up to about USD 87m, which reflects the strategic, targeted nature of the UN engagement in Algeria as a Middle-Income Country. A few agencies account for the majority of the programme delivery (more than 70%). There are opportunities for efficiency gains in managing administrative services (labor cost avoidance), but the UN demand for services remains modest in size compared to the Algeria market (and therefore limited leverage to push prices down significantly), and the quality of services offered varies greatly and is not always up to the UN standards.

Algeria already has a good tradition of combining services for premises (3 agencies manage premises jointly with others), travel (LTA in place used by most agencies), security (one security company trained by UNDSS provides service most agencies), etc. These were formalized in the BOS together with several other new services, such as shared local payment processing, common LTA for consumable procurement, the establishment of the PSEA network, a rotation mechanism for the diplomatic pouch.

During the the first year of BOS implementation (2021-22), the efforts deployed by the OMT Group in Algeria made it possible to realize the BOS implementation plan at 63%. Cost savings were mainly determined by common premises management, cleaning and security services as turnkey solutions. Discussions on joint services for protocol, identified as a potential savings driver, gained momentum in late 2021 and are ongoing.

In March 2022, the first BOS annual review exercise allowed to complete and advance this work. A total of 24 existing services common to at least 3 agencies (depending on the service) have been analyzed. Most of these are expected to continue 'as is' (77%),  while 3 services  (Maintenance of ICT equipment , Central Database for LTAs, and Central Database for Supplier Performance) are expected to be upscaled.

In terms of future cooperation, 27 common services were identified for the analysis of opportunities. For example, the activation of a Human resources knowledge sharing platform will help monitor implementation and develop new solutions for services. Opportunities for collaboration were identified in new areas, such as finance with capacity development activities and the establishment of a shared micro-assessment database and a financial spot check, ICT for common ICT disaster recovery planning, maintenance of ICT equipment, procurement with the establishment of common database for LTAs and supplier performance, and the mapping of premises accessibility as a basis for disability inclusion initiatives.

(1) Expected cost avoidance

A total expected cost avoidance of USD 693,913 has been identified for the 5-year period 2022-2026. Most of the it is derived under the management of common premises common service line, representing about 64% of total expected cost avoidance, followed by security services (24%) and cleaning services (9%).

(2) Expected Quality Improvement

In terms of expected quality improvements, for example, in administration, the maintenance of shared security services should result in the employment of security officers who are continuously trained and acquainted with UN standards, included PSEA. The extension of OMT HR WG beyond the annual review constitute a true opportunity for further service integration and knowledge sharing. For ICT, better quality and reliability are expected in terms of Internet access and use through standardized help desk solutions. Joint recruitment committees could help speed up the recruitment process and build staff confidence in the fairness of the process. Centralizing and sharing information on LTA, Vendor performances, will ultimately allow faster access and better quality in procurement, including gender parity and PSEA standards. The harmonization of salary scales for consultants, together with other services discussed but not included in the BOS, will be prepared and recognized in next year’s annual review exercise.

ECU;Ecuador;333;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The United Nations Operational Reform promoted by the Secretary General, seeks for its organisms (funds, agencies and programs) to be more effective and efficient in supporting countries towards the achievement of the 2030 development transformational goals.

The reforms undertaken within the organization are expected to have several benefits such as: greater co-responsibility, cohesion, transparency and optimized processes. It is also expected that there will be actions to avoid costs and improve the quality of operational services.

In the long term, these principles should have a faster impact of progress towards reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The Reform´s planned goals foresee that by 2021 all UNCTs have a Business Operation Strategy (BOS) in place ; by 2022 consolidation of Location Dependant Services through the Common Back Offices; advance in the options of Location Independant Services creating a network of 7 Global Shared Services Centers (GSSC) and consolidation of  50% of UN agencies offices in common premises by 2021.
 
What will enable the accomplishment of these goals is the operationalization of the mutual recognition principle, that has been endorsed by more than 20 UN organizations; and a culture of change centred in client satisfaction, with an appropriate measurement of operational services.
 
Since the year 2000, Ecuador has been working in the following points: common premises (UN House) considering central offices in the capital city and common premises at the field; collaborative services through LTAs (Long Term Agreements) and the application of the mutual recognition principle since it´s establishment.

The Business Operation Strategy (BOS) is a fundamental instrument that reinforces efficient operations that effectively support programmatic initiatives.

In this context, UNCT Ecuador has developed a committed work with OMT, and therefore BOS was implemented in the years 2021 and 2022 and will be implemented in year 2023. It will include 19 services distributed in the following lines of services:  4 in Human Resources, 6 in Procurement, 6 in Administration, 1 in Finance and 2 in ICT.

It is important to mention that for the BOS 2021-2022,  18 services were selected: LTA Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) methodology was applied in 2 services, Detailed Cost Benefit Analysis (DETAILED CBA) was applied in 2 services  which yields a monetary benefit or cost avoidance of US$293.255 during a period of   2 years. The other 14 services considered in BOS do not have CBA and are mainly focused on significant quality improvement, inclusion of cross-cutting approaches and principles of inclusion for the disabled, gender and environmental sustainability."
EGY;Egypt;302;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Egypt is one of the 50 founding members of the United Nations and the United Nations in Egypt has partnered with the Government of Egypt since 1952. The UN has currently 39 UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes in Egypt, including 17 Regional Offices. The UN in Egypt employs over 1,770 Egyptian nationals in addition to 550 internationals. Egypt is the fifth largest UN country and in terms of land area, Egypt is the second biggest of the Arab countries (after Algeria).

In Egypt, the partnership between the UN and the Government of Egypt is outlined through a five-year partnership agreement, currently the 2018-2022 United Nations Partnership Development Framework (UNPDF). The UNPDF is fully aligned with the national sustainable development strategy, Egypt Vision 2030, which is in turn aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The budget for the UNPDF is set at USD 1.2 billion.

The United Nations Business Operations Strategy (BOS), is a critical instrument to enhance collaboration in UN support services at the country level and improve cost-efficiency, reduce duplication and decrease administrative and transaction costs. Member States in resolution 72/279 OP 6 set the goal for all UN Country Teams to have a quality BOS in place by 2021, along with a Common Back Office by 2022 to support location-dependent services reflected in the BOS. As part of this effort, 72 UNCTs already have a common business operations strategy in place (up from 63 in 2018).

To meet these targets, a revised and streamlined BOS 2.0 was launched in October 2019 by the UNSDG with DCO supporting its rollout across all UNCTs. The BOS 2.0 guidance is supported by an on-line platform for accelerating process, improving data availability on BOS targets. The platform also facilitates better reporting and visibility on impacts and progress of the BOS implementation across countries and regions, in terms efficiency and quality gains.

Within this context, the OMT in Egypt has, under the guidance of the Resident Coordinator, for the first time developed a BOS for 2020-2023. The process has been led by the OMT working groups: Human Resources (HR), Admin (which includes administrative and logistic topics), Procurement, Finance and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The BOS will outline all inter-agency harmonization and operations activities planned to integrate in the UNPDF 2018-2022, while incorporating various operational analyses.  

It should also be noted, that the remaining proposed Common Service are expected to yield significant quality improvements which is not captured in the expected cost avoidance. 

EXISTING COMMON SERVICES
Egypt already has a history of combining its common services for certain service lines including Procurement and ICT; for which WGs were already formed; in 2014 for Procurement and an interagency WG for ICT had started to form around 2008. Following WGs were newly formed as part of initiating the BOS Exercise in Egypt in 2019, these include: Admin & Logistics, Finance, and Human Resources. 

The Stock Take identified a total of 21 Existing Common Services. In terms of Actions to be Taken for these Existing Common Services, a total of 14% of Common Services are to be ‘Continued As Is’, 29% `Discontinued`, 5% `Modified`, 10% `scale down` and a total of 43% are to be ‘Scaled Up’. 

FUTURE COOPERATION
27 Common Services in total were identified for the Opportunity Analysis, 16 of them are included in the BOS plan. In terms of the Cost-Benefit Analysis, both expected total cost avoided and expected quality improvements need to be considered when deciding which new common services will be included in the BOS and prioritizing specific Common Services.

Expected Cost Avoidance
An expected total cost avoidance of USD 6.9 M identified for Egypt for the period of 2019-2024. The majority of the cost avoidance is expected to result from Admin at USD 5.7 M. Procurement will largely implement the expected cost avoidance to be accrued under Admin. This is followed by ICT at USD 1.2 M.

Travel Services is considered the highest service yielding Cost Avoidance of USD 1.7 M USD, followed by Conference and events management with USD 1.3 M, followed by Mobile Phone services with an expected cost avoidance of USD 0.8 M

BOS Annual Review for 2022
2022 marked as the second year in the implementation of the Business Operation Strategy (BOS).  A total of 32 common Long- Term Agreements (LTAs) in various fields of services have been finalized and currently being used by many UN agencies. The LTAs covered key services areas including transportation, travel, media and video production, events management, ICT and security services. The employment of these LTAs contributed to enhancing the synergy and the harmonization of UN action and thus enhance the overall efficiency of UN activities within Egypt. The 2022 Annual BOS review showed that an overall efficiency cost avoidance of 1.6 M USD has been realized.
 
Expected Quality Improvements
In terms of expected quality improvements, there are significant benefits outlined across all Common Service Lines. Following main themes in quality improvement are observed and expected to be achieved across WGs. 

First, quality improvements in products and services standards are expected across the board. For example, in Admin, this is expected to result from the employment of more highly professionally-trained guards and interpretation & translation services. For Finance, combining HACT audit services is expected to improve audit quality by harmonizing audit processes thereby leading to less duplication & missing data. For ICT, better quality and reliability is expected in terms of internet & mobile phone connectivity and VSat services. For HR, combining services is expected to lead to an increased reliability of vendors and the ability to supply at UN required volumes, such as for specialized Staff Training service. For procurement, improved reliable access to high quality vendors is expected by creating centralized databases for vendors and LTAs.

Second, service and product standards are expected to be more on par with UN standards. For example, in Admin this is expected to improve standards in video quality; furniture and fitting requirements; UN security requirements; and conference & event management requirements.

Third, additional special services and services tailored specifically to the UN are expected. For example, in Admin expected add-on services include vendors offering a dedicated hotline for transport services; the availability of after-sales services for furniture & fittings; dedicated focal points for security services. In HR, add-on services are expected to be gained from vendors such as offering special job posting pages specifically for UN recruitments. For ICT, additional support services are expected to be provided by vendors such as mobile operators and ISP providers. 

Fourth, increased time efficiency & flexibility and reduced response times to requests are expected. For example, in Admin the availability of sufficient vehicles is expected for Transport and Printing & Video services are expected to meet the ad-hoc requests from Programmes. For Procurement, centralizing databases for vendors and LTAs is expected to lead to quicker response time due to less duplication work processes. For Finance, engaging in combined HACT audit services is expected to lead to significant improvement in time efficiency due to avoiding duplication of processes in assessments, assurances and capacity building.

Fifth, improved transparency in reporting and performance information is expected from vendors. In Finance, improved transparency in reporting and risk mitigation is expected by combining HACT auditing services and by engaging a reputable service provider. For Procurement, centralizing databases for vendors and LTAs is expected to improve the transparency and range of suppliers available.

ERI;Eritrea;336;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"In December 2017 the UN Secretary-General (SG) issued a proposal to reposition the United Nations Development System. For business operations the SG included a requirement for all UN Country Teams (UNCTs) to comply with improved Business Operations Strategies (BOS) by 2021 under Administrative Instructions Number A/72/684–E/2018/7. Following the proposal of the SG, in October 2019, the UNSDG Business Innovation Group (BIG) issued the guidance and methodology to develop BOS 2.0 in 131 UNCTs. As stated by the UN Secretary General, ""The goal of reform is a 21st-century United Nations focused more on people and less on process, more on delivery and less on bureaucracy”.

In line with the Administrative Instructions of the UN Secretary General, the UN agencies, funds and programmes and funds (AFPs) in Eritrea have developed and rolled out the BOS 2.0. They have recently undertaken its review to draw key results and lessons.

The implementation of the BOS, as part of the UN efficiency agenda, was aimed at bringing together the AFPs in Eritrea to plan and deliver results collectively towards enhancing coherence, efficiency, and effectiveness. In total 10 resident UN agencies, namely FAO, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNICEF, UNFPA, UNHCR, RCO, OCHA, WFP and WHO have worked together and implemented common activities across the six common service lines.

In addition, the updated BOS has also factored in activities with potential SDG impacts such as the inclusion of the greening initiative with the installation of the common solar system, the consideration of gender-responsive procurement sourcing in promoting business development with female-owned or managed enterprises. To ensure inclusiveness, the BOS review has also made provision to ensure level 2 accessibility to the UN Common premises and offices. Furthermore, activities related to the enhanced and continued awareness of staff members on prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA) and related reporting mechanisms have been added.

The signing and launching of the 2022-2026 Cooperation Framework between the Government of the State of Eritrea and the UN System has resulted in increased cooperation and strategic partnership to achieve development results for the people of Eritrea. The UN system in Eritrea has a built-in monitoring and evaluation mechanism to track progress in the implementation of BOS and note any challenges that require redress. This work is done by the Operations Management Team (OMT) and is premised on established clear procedures for efficiency and effectiveness in programme delivery.

The review of this BOS 2023 has been done through a very consultative process with all members of the working groups having participated in the BOS review workshop. The exercise of the stock conducted by the working groups has concluded that for 4 yeas from 2019 - 2022, UN agencies in Eritrea have collectively realized a stock avoidance of US$1.6 Million. BOS services that have resulted in high impact costs savings have been in the provision of security of services and cleaning, Printing services and vehicle rental. Other activities have started in 2022 with notable cost avoidance in the construction of the outdoor Gym facility as part of the staff wellbeing initiatives, the common internet connectivity using the 03b technology and the installation of the common UN solar whose business case developed by the UNDP Green Team is under review by the OMT.

 It is expected that the updated BOS will achieve a cost avoidance of US$422,645 with the main cost drivers remaining in the areas of Printings, followed by Security services and slightly in vehicles rental.

The OMT and its working groups have collectively acknowledged that the main challenges in BOS implementation in 2022 have been weak the weak institutional arrangements and structures to implement the planned activities. To overcome these challenges, the Working groups will be strengthened to improve effectivity and efficiency in the reporting of the status of implementation of the BOS activities by the

ETH;Ethiopia;338;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"In order to support the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) for the period 2020-2025, which was signed between the UN and the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in September 2020, the Operations Management Team, under the leadership of the UN Country Team developed the Business Operations Strategy (BOS) 2.0 (2020 – 2025). The main purpose of the Strategy is to coordinate and align the activities of the UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes (AFP) in Ethiopia to enable more efficient and effective service delivery, mitigate duplication of processes, curtail transaction costs and enhance operational efficiencies.

The BOS 2.0 (2020-2025) was developed through the BOS online platform on 01 July 2020. The BOS focuses on common services that are implemented jointly or delivered by one UN entity on behalf of one or more other UN entities. Common services for future collaboration were identified in the areas of Common Administration services, Common Finance services, Common Human Resources services, Common Information and Communications Technology (ICT) services, Common Logistics, and Procurement services. Participating AFP are identified in the accountability framework, which is regularly reviewed and updated. In line with the global guidance, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator (RC/ HC), is accountable to the Secretary-General for the development, implementation, monitoring and reporting of results achieved under the BOS 2.0. The UNCT provides overall oversight of the BOS 2.0 process, approval and release of necessary resources, the sign off of the final BOS 2.0 and the annual progress reporting exercise. The Operations Management Team and its subsidiary bodies are responsible to facilitate the development and implementation of the BOS at the country level. The Development Coordination Office (DCO) is responsible for coordination, guidance and support to UNCT and UN RC/ HC on the BOS 2.0.

Following its development in 2020, the BOS 2.0. underwent its first annual review from January – March 2022. The second annual review of BOS2.0 was conducted from 01 January 2023 up to 31 March 2023. This is a light review focusing on the reporting of realized efficiencies for 2022, adjusting, where needed, projections for the future years, and updating the activities in the planning framework.

In total, 37 common services for HR 11, three for Finance, five for Procurement, five for ICT, 12 for Administration, and one for Logistics were implemented in 2022. Among these common services, 14 of them are CBA type which provided both quality improvement and cost avoidance and the remaining common services focused only on quality improvement. The cost avoidance realized by implementing 14 CBA-type common services stands at USD 4.4 million. In the previous time, the data obtained from different secretariat agencies were consolidated under the UN but for this year it was disaggregated among UNS-ECA, UNS-OCHA, UNS-OHCHR, UNS-Other, UNS-UNCTAD, UNS-UNEP, UNS-UN HABITAT and UNS-UNODC. A key focus for the OMT in 2022 was the implementation of the UN Disability Inclusion as well as Gender Parity agendas. In this connection, Common Logistics and Procurement Working Group put the inclusion of Disability Inclusion as well as Gender Parity agendas in a solicitation document as mandatory criteria.

2022 was another challenging year. The six-month state of emergency in response to reversals on the battlefield and Tigrayan forces advancing deeply into Amhara and Afar Regional States was lifted in February 2022. Following almost two years of intense conflict, an Agreement for Lasting Peace through a Permanent Cessation of Hostilities was signed between the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (GoE) and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) in Pretoria on 2 November 2022. The toll from the war has been huge: loss of lives, a large humanitarian caseload, widespread displacement and extensive damage to infrastructure and services. These effects have been compounded by the crisis in Ukraine, impacting adversely on poverty and human development, fiscal space, debt, forex reserves, ODA inflows and inflation, hamstringing Ethiopia’s ambitious economic and governance reform programmes and setting back progress towards the SDGs. Against this background, the UN Country Team is in an especially strong position among Ethiopia’s development partners to respond quickly and effectively to rehabilitation, recovery, and reconstruction needs in northern Ethiopia.

In 2023, the OMT has agreed to reinvigorate the OMT and OMT Working Groups and implementation of the BOS toward achieving further cost and quality efficiency targes as set for the UN Ethiopia BOS Strategy 2020 - 2025. The implementation will continue to be monitored on a regular basis under the overall guidance of the UNCT. "
FJI;Fiji;339;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The United Nations Pacific Strategy (UNPS) 2018-2022 sets the strategic vision and outlines the collective response of the UN system to the development priorities in 14 Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs), specifically: Cook Islands, Fiji, Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Republic of Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.

The Business Operations Strategy (BOS) is a results-based framework that focuses on joint business operations with the purpose of eliminating duplication, leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN and maximizing economies of scale. The BOS was created in 2012 as a response to a call for simplification and harmonization of the United Nations system. The Secretary-General mandates all United Nations Country Teams (UNCTs) to ensure compliance with an improved BOS by 2021, in support of a more effective programme delivery on the 2030 Agenda. The BOS focuses on common services that are implemented jointly or delivered by one UN entity on behalf of other UN entities

Since the launch of BOS 2.0, Fiji UNCT and OMT have developed their BOS 2.0 which focuses on establishing common operations services at the country level to support implementation of the UN programmatic mandate in a more efficient and cost-effective manner.

The Fiji BOS platform was updated from 2019. The main objective of BOS is to help UN in Pacific to further sharpen operational efficiency, harness resource mobilization and strengthen implementation of UN Programmes by guiding the UNCT and operational teams in their business relations with key suppliers and vendors, implementing partners and other operational stakeholders. The BOS monitoring and annual review is developed as supplementary to support the UNSDG entities and the UNCTs to monitor and track the implementation of the agreed common services in BOS and report on utilization of the benefits realized and the quality enhancements achieved from the collaborative operational services.

The OMT used the Annual Work Plan mechanism to operationalize the BOS and the annual progress reports to take stock of the results and undertake corrective measures, if needed. The BOS progress report will be reflected into the overall Country Results Report of the UNPS.

The BOS Review exercise is done in March 2022, where all the participating agencies have updated the actual dollar values spent for each common service lines against the projections made. The labor costs were also updated for each service lines that the agencies have been using. All the common service lines that Fiji has committed to in BOS were reviewed and reported on. It was noted that most of the agencies did not have any realized value to report on for the common service lines due to the reason that the LTA’s were established in late September 2021 for those Common services. Also due to COVID pandemic not many activities were done in 2021, hence agencies did not have anything to report on for those common services as realized costs.

The BOS CBA review reflects the total costs avoidance of USD753,330 as of 27 May 2022. The highest costs avoidance was from the Travel Services and from Printing services. The other impacting common services were Conference & Event Management, Security Services, Stationary Procurement and Vehicle rental. The total costs avoidance does not reflect the actual costs avoidance because of COVID Pandemic situation that was currently faced by Fiji. The actual costs of the common services were low for 2021 as there were no major activities and travels happening in 2021 and this has resulted in a low vale of actual costs against a high projection amount leading to a high-cost avoidance amount. In normal operations circumstances with full travels and activities happening, the actual costs are anticipated to be high than the current lower actual costs due to the COVID Pandemic situation. The focus of current cost benefit analysis is on the labor and transaction cost avoidance.

As part of the BOS monitoring process, the OMT and its sub-working groups will undertake service quality assessments and “client” satisfaction surveys. This will enable UNCT and OMT to ensure that the delivered services comply with the needs and demands of the internal and external beneficiaries. The monitoring will flag any operational bottlenecks and risks throughout the BOS implementation and will inform on any adjustments needed to ensure that the BOS is on track towards achievement of its outcomes.

Having the LTA’s in place and with full operational activities, Fiji UNCT will be reporting its realized in the next BOS review exercise showing the actual cost avoidance under full operational capacity. Fiji is also in the process of including more common service lines for Disability Inclusion, Gender Responsive Procurements and Sustainable Procurement in the Working Group Annual Work Plan for 2022 and in BOS."

The UN RCO and twenty-five UN agencies have committed to work together in pursuit of the strategic priorities laid out in the UNSDCF 2023-2027. The UN resident agencies participating in the Business Operations Strategy (BOS) are FAO, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, WHO and the UN RCO. The other UN entities belonging to the UNCT, who either are non-resident or not (yet) participating in the BOS, include AIEA, IFAD, ILO, IMF, IOM, ITU, OHCHR, UNAIDS, UNCTAD, UNECA, UNEP, UN HABITAT, UNIDO, UNOCA, UNODC, UN VOLUNTEERS, UN WOMEN, World Bank.

In joint statements, the UN Resident Coordinator and the Prime Minister have committed to work together to achieve the SDGs in Gabon, an intent which is captured in a Government Decree establishing the Steering Committee overseeing UN-Gabon development cooperation. To support the delivery of the UNSDCF facilitating the achievement of the SDGs in Gabon, the UNCT and the Government agreed to a governance structure which includes the Operations Management Team (OMT). Realisation of results articulated in the BOS is one of the key deliverables for the OMT. Delivery enhancement will be attained through the use of Long-Term Agreements (LTAs), common negotiated contracts with favourable ratings due to economies of scale and the scale-up of carpooling which will help save time and promoting Value for Money. Collaboration on cross-cutting issues in areas such as gender, disability inclusion, Greening and staff well-being is also being pursued for an efficient and effective attainment of the set objectives.

The OMT has prioritised the delivery of the UN Secretary General’s efficiency agenda through implementation of the BOS and effective management of already existing UN common premises. Through the implementation of the BOS, the UNCT achieved cost avoidance of USD 287,214 in 2020- 2021 against USD 607,930 that had been projected. The expected cost avoidance up to the year 2025 is USD 2.6 million. These cost savings will be achieved through enhanced collaboration in the implementation of 18 common services. In addition to the cost avoidance indicator, Gabon’s UNCT also prioritised quality improvement indicators across all Common Service Lines. To support effective and efficient delivery of the UNSDCF, the OMT works through 5 OMT Working Groups (WG), including:

Human Resources WG who prioritised the following aims:
- Mapping of talents (including persons living with a disability)
- Staff training and activities for Disability Inclusion

Administration WG who prioritised:
- Carpooling
- Common cleaning services
- Common radio services
- Diplomatic pouch
- Fuel management
- Harmonized travel allowances for implementing partners
- Management of common UN premises
- Security services (outsourced)
 
Finance and HACT (Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfers) WG who prioritised a unified approach for tax refunds and exemption

ICT (Information Communication Technologies) WG who prioritised:
- Internet connectivity and VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) services
- Mobile phone services including scratch cards

Procurement WG who prioritised:
- Accessibility (Disability and Inclusion) in procurement services
- Environmental responsive procurement sourcing
- Gender responsive procurement sourcing
- Joint procurement services
- Mapping and expansion of accessible venues (Disability & Inclusion)

The growing global demand for the harmonization and integration of key services that has resulted from the reform of the United Nations system in Gabon calls for a strengthened strategic focus and enhanced planning, budgeting and prioritization of joint initiatives and faster improvements in coordination, communication, and ways of working using appropriate technologies to boost both efficiency and cost-effectiveness of business operations. This will require persistent high-level commitment and leadership across all levels of the UN system and within different UN entities so that joint work can identify and streamline common business operations and produce the desired impact.

GEO;Georgia;342;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The United Nations system in Georgia is a unique set of diverse institutions –funds, programs and specialized agencies – united by common vision for the development of Georgia and empowerment of its people. Working closely with the government of Georgia, civil society, and other national and international partners, the UN works to respond to national development needs and improve the economic and social conditions of people in Georgia. Within its mandate to support Georgia to achieve its national priorities, the United Nations is providing tailor-made support to address the issues of sustainable human development while also supporting the national priority goal of European integration.

UN’s support covers a diverse range of areas, including economic well-being, health, human rights, education, agriculture, industry, environmental protection, gender equality, effective governance and the rule of law. In the crisis areas, UN stands with people who suffer from crises and need help in relief and recovery. As a reliable partner to the people of Georgia in addressing key national challenges and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the UN brings worldwide experience and advice to help Georgia build a better life and become a prosperous, peaceful, and resilient society, leaving no one behind.

 2021 – 2025 UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) represents the ambition of the UN System to Deliver as One and achieve transformative change, with greater transparency and accountability that meet Georgia’s expectations, as we enter the Decade of Action for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

Building on the national SDG progress, as noted above, and keeping in mind that “leaving no one behind” is the central approach to this Cooperation Framework, the UN in collaboration and consultation with the Government of Georgia and other stakeholders will address the development challenges identified above to achieve the following vision based on one joint transformative strategic priority:

 Enhanced human wellbeing, capabilities and social equality in Georgia by 2025.

The strategic priority above will be achieved through 5 outcomes as identified below in the Cooperation Framework:

Outcome 1: By 2025, all people in Georgia enjoy improved good governance, more open, resilient and accountable institutions, rule of law, equal access to justice, human rights, and increased representation and participation of women in decision-making.
Outcome 2: By 2025, all people in Georgia have equitable and inclusive access to quality, resilient and gender-sensitive services delivered in accordance with international human rights standards.
Outcome 3: By 2025, all people without discrimination benefit from a sustainable, inclusive and resilient economy in Georgia.
Outcome 4: By 2025, conflict affected communities enjoy human rights, enhanced human security and resilience.
Outcome 5: By 2025, all people, without discrimination, enjoy enhanced resilience through improved environmental governance, climate action and sustainable management and use of natural resources in Georgia.

Within this context, the new Business Operations Strategy (BOS) 2021 - 2025 was produced by the UN Operations Management Team and became operational from 1 January 2021. BOS  enables the UN in Georgia to take a strategic and results-oriented approach to planning, management and implementation of harmonized business operations at the country level, aligning operational activities with programme activities outlined in the UNSDCF.

At the same time, the BOS maps and outlines critical aspects for inter-agency harmonization needed for an effective delivery of the UNSDCF, in line with Agencies policies and procedures and the operational / common services baseline.

This is especially important to ensure UN’s efficient and smooth response to the COVID-19 crisis. From the very beginning, the UN repurposed and channeled its resources to support the Government and other partners in protecting public health and advocating for “leaving no one behind” during the pandemic. These efforts have been devoted to a wide range of areas: not only in supporting the healthcare system, but also in improving social protection, protecting jobs and livelihoods, and sustaining social cohesion and community resilience.

28 Common services were identified in the areas of Human Resources, Finance, ICT, Procurement, Common Administration/Common premises and Logistics. The proposed joint interventions in these common service lines with the focus on cost effectiveness, enhanced quality with operational focus and prioritization is projected to generate a total cost avoidance amounting   $3.6 million. 

It is also worth mentioning that Georgia completed the Common Premises (CP) plan ahead of time and was praised by HQ for exemplary coordination and teamwork demonstrated by the UNCT CP focal points and the CP Coordinators.

In addition, the Common Services Management Team in Georgia, has strived to incorporate innovation, sustainability, and other elements in support of the SDGs into the new BOS. In terms of environmental sustainability, the following interesting activities and measures have been introduced: introduction of solar energy as part of the common premises energy supply; efficient management of the organizational resources such as energy efficient lighting, installation of energy efficient windows, charging station for electric vehicle, paper collection and recycling, paper usage reduction measures, e-waste recycling. All these measures will lead to reduction of GHG emissions.

In 2023, OMT has worked together for entering CBA data foe 2022 and identified realized cost avoidance of USD 1,890,638 on country level."
GHA;Ghana;343;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The Business Operations Strategy (BOS) 2018-2022 is a medium-term strategic plan developed by the UNCT in a framework aligning UN joint business operations for more efficient and effective service delivery to support the implementation of UN programmes envisioned in the UNSDP 2018-2022.

The BOS focuses primarily on efficiency gains and costs avoidance and aims to enhance internal transaction cost avoidance while simultaneously improving quality of services, including cost savings on externally sourced goods and services. It will do so by eliminating duplication of efforts, leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN and maximizing economies of scale.

It targets common business services that are implemented jointly or delivered by one UN entity on behalf of one or more other UN entities. Common services for future collaboration were identified in the areas of Common Administration, Finance, Human Resources, Information and Communications Technology (ICT), Logistics, and Procurement services.

Selection of key common business priority areas was done through a consultative process that involved all UN organizations in Ghana. The OMT used estimated figures based on baseline data, where applicable, to determine the feasibility of business solutions and their respective anticipated cost efficiencies.

During the BOS cycle in Ghana, the UNCT anticipates the efficiency gains of USD 2,587,244 over the period 2018 – 2022 through Transaction and Monetary cost avoidance. It is envisaged that USD1,368,225, representing 53% of the savings is attributed to ICT common services.  Several other high impact services aimed at achieving the SDGs have been added, like those targeting the PWDs. Though they do not necessarily result in cost avoidance, they are considered critical for aligning the BOS 2.0 activities with the strategic direction of the UNSCDF currently under development in Ghana and in the achievement of the SDGs.

The UNCT provides overall oversight of the BOS process, approval and release of necessary UN Organizations and joint resources, sign off the final BOS 2.0 and annual reporting.

 In addition to the participating agencies captured in the current BOS, there are a number of externally based entities who are operating in Ghana who are benefitting from BOS implementation and are expected to integrate into the system under the new generation Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework in Ghana, 2022-2025. These include IAEA, OHCHR, DPPA, ITC, ITU, PAGE, Global Pulse, UNCTAD, UNDESA, UNECA, UNEP, UNITAR, UNOWAS, UNV, UN Women, and UNWTO. Though there are no documented cost avoidance benefits gained by these agencies, it is assumed that they have an indirect benefit from several of the activities that they implement in Ghana.

The UN in Ghana is committed to fostering diversity and inclusion and is taking concrete steps to create a culture and environment that is open, Inclusive, of and accessible to persons with disabilities.

In a world moving dynamically and a lot of digital solutions appearing on daily basis. The UN in Ghana is committed to explore all those options, finding opportunities that are fit for purpose to increase efficiency and enhance innovation and informed UN system in Ghana that is not sticking doing business as usual.

GIN;Guinea;345;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Since 2018, the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Guinea is implementing the Business Operation Strategy with the overall goal of being efficient while supporting the ongoing UNDAF (2018-2022) and operational demands both development and humanitarian settings.

The BOS is particularly concerned with reducing costs while concurrently enhancing service quality, including eliminating duplication of effort, utilizing the UN's collective bargaining strength, and optimizing economies of scale.

The approach focuses on shared services that are implemented collaboratively or provided on behalf of one or more UN entities by one UN institution. The BOS is implemented and operationalized through six (6) OMT Working Groups (Human Resources; Finance; Procurement; Administration; ICT; Logistics) to support shared planning, monitoring, and reporting for results under the direction of the OMT The BOS aims to improve the UNCT's assistance for program delivery and business operations in terms of cost effectiveness, quality, and efficiency.

The UNCT is made up of 23 members from UN agencies, funds, and programs, both resident and non-resident. These are:

Resident agencies: FAO, UNESCO, IOM, UN-RCS, UNAIDS, IFAD, UNCDF, UNESCO, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNIDO, UNOPS, WFP, ITC, UNHCR, OHCHR, UN Habitat, UNDSS, and WHO.

Non-resident agencies: UNWOMEN, UNODC, ILO, and UNEP.

IFIs: World Bank and International Monetary Fund

Throughout the development of BOS 2.0, the Operations Management Team (OMT) and its technical Working Groups across the various UN Organizations had consultations to improve the performance of their systems.

The estimated cost savings for the 5-year period has been revised down to consider only local collaborations and remove all HQ arrangement of services provided to agencies as well as to consider utilized services where agencies are really engaged to collaborate. Therefore, following the 2022 annual review process, the estimated cost benefit was $ 5,782,366 while the realized reported is $ 3 167 419.

Overall, the focus of the 2022 BOS review was not just on examining and evaluating the services, but also on drafting a more precise implementation plan with more definite deadlines. Meanwhile, to facilitate follow-up, lead agencies and responsible persons for operations under each service are updated.

During the 2022 review, working groups decided as “do not include” for ten (10 services) while they have added eleven (11) new common services from different service lines and service categories. Among the new services there are several highly recommended services:  

1) Air Charter Services,
2)      Green IT,
3)      Knowledge Sharing,
4)      Micro Assessment Database,
5)      Mapping of talents and disability,
6)      Staff training on disability,
7)      Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA),
8)      Integrated web-based Roster for consultants,
9)      Cash disbursement and transfer
10)   Green Solar energy.
11) Graphic Design

In terms of gender, the UNCT gender group assessed the UNCT-SWAP gender equality scorecard with the help of UN Women and issued a report with critical recommendations. Gender approaches in procurement processes for women-owned firms should be considered by OMT. "
GMB;Gambia;341;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in The Gambia implemented the Business Operation Strategy in 2021 with the overall aim of achieving greater impact by being coherent and effective in delivering development results and humanitarian support, while harmonizing business practices across agencies for increased efficiency.

The BOS focused primarily on increasing efficiency and cost avoidance while simultaneously improving quality of service and eliminating duplication of efforts. It also focused on leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN in order to maximize economies of scale.

In order to help the UNCT realize the objectives of the Country Planning Frame (CPF), the OMT through the BOS 2.0 six thematic Common Service areas (Administration, including common Facilities/Premises; Human Resources; Information, Communications and Technology (ICT); Finance, Logistics and Procurement) will support Programme/Project implementation by increasing operational efficiencies, avoiding unnecessary costs and eliminating duplications and ultimately increasing service delivery to member states.

The BOS 2.0 therefore, underscores key priority areas arising from discussions, which are strengthened by a detailed operational analysis. Short and medium-term strategic results were also identified, that will guide the monitoring and evaluation of operations in the six (6) common services during the programme cycle of the Gambia’s UNSDCF

UN Gambia is comprised of 21 Agencies, of which 13 are Resident Agencies (FAO, IOM, UNAIDS, UNCDF, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNOPS, UNODC, WFP and WHO, IFIs: IMF & WB) and 8 are Non Resident agencies (UNECA, ILO, UNOCHA, UN-HABITAT, UNESCO, UNWOMEN, UNIDO,.

In order to obtain the quality improvement and cost avoidance of the BOS 2.0, the OMT will focus on the high impact Common Services such as:
1.      Installing a Renewable Energy system at the UN House and if possible in all other Agency buildings
2.      Gender Responsive Procurement Services
3.      Disability access to all UN buildings/Offices
4.      Developing LTAs for Internet connectivity

Following the BOS review, the total budget of the BOS collaboration has been revised from USD 581,790 to USD 264,474 over the five-year period with costs shared among participating agencies and funding on annual basis.

After the annual review on the achieved benefits and the BOS review process, the expected cost avoidance to be achieved during the 5- year period has been revised from USD 194,660 to USD 70,414. Quality improvement is at the center of the BOS collaboration and this has been emphasized by the UNCT.

Overall, during the 2022 BOS review, considerable focus was put on not only reviewing and assessing the services, but also developing a more detailed implementation plan with more specific timelines. Meanwhile, lead Agencies and responsible persons for activities under each service were reviewed and updated.  

Gender responsiveness remains a high priority for the BOS and included gender related KPIs in HR common Services and in procurement common services.

The UNCT members have committed to allocate financial and human resources for the achievement of BOS objectives and make active use of the mutual recognition as a veritable driver of the collaboration."

The OMT has prioritized delivery of the SG’s efficiency agenda through implementation of BOS, Common Back Office and Common Premises. Through the implementation of BOS, the UNCT expect to achieve the cost avoidance of USD 811,942 through harmonization of business operations over the year period of 5 years. During the BOS annual review in 2022, the UNCT was able to realise USD 441,982 as cost avoidance.

In addition to the cost avoidance indicator the UNCT, has also prioritised quality improvement indicators across the Common Service Lines. To support effective and efficient delivery of the UNSDCF the OMT will work through 6 OMT Working Groups and these are:

- Human Resources WG which has prioritised: Comprehensive salary survey, Recruitment, Inclusion of relevant Youth 2030 strategy priorities in BOS, Disability inclusion and Psychosocial support working in collaboration with the Health and Wellbeing Group.
- Common Premises and have prioritised: Accessibility for all abled and differently abled person, collaboration on solar projects, car pooling, cleaning in the COVID context and security of UN staff and dependents through UNDSS.

Among the UN resident agencies in the Equatorial Guinea Republic, the following agencies participated in the BOS 2022: FAO, PNUD, UNFPA, UNICEF, OMS and RCO (Resident Coordinator Office). UNAIDS and non-resident agencies like ILO and UNESCO share costs among the rest agencies in the common premises budget, with only one or two staff in the Country.

The BOS focuses on communal services that are implemented in a way that converges the management by one UN entity in the name of the other UN entities. The existence of a UN House facilitates the collaboration between all the agencies of the UN in the country. For the implementation of BOS 2.0, we identified collaboration in four areas of services, among them: 1) Common services of TIC (2) Common services of administration (which include installations and common services), 3) Common financial services and 4) Communal logistics services.

BOS Exercise 
The Business Operation Strategy (BOS) is a key component of the UN reform and so of the efficiency agenda that seeks to enhance the quality and cost effectiveness of joint business operations at the country level in order to generate efficiencies to better support the 2030 Agenda.

In 2018, Guatemala developed its 2018-2020 BOS as a timely response to the UN Secretary General vision to reposition the UN development system and the recommendation to identify ways to enhance cooperation, collaboration and coordination with the purpose to reduce transaction costs and demonstrate operational efficiency by eliminating the duplication of processes within business operations; leveraging the common buying positions of the UN; and maximizing economies of scale.

The Guatemala's BOS primarily focuses on efficiency gains and cost reductions. By promoting the collaborative work, the BOS seeks to reduce transaction costs and also to achieve cost savings on externally sourced goods and services

The Guatemala UNCT recognizes that the quality of the support to the business operations is critical for programme delivery and in-country office operations. The “One Business” operating model provides to the Country Teams with an outline for strategic and cost effective common operational support to the implementation of the programmes by capitalizing on existing agency operational capacities and enhancing service provision activities.

The Business Operations Strategy has proven to be a highly valuable tool for the One UN in Guatemala. It has allowed for the conceptualization of opportunities and substantial cost reductions, as well as efficiency gains that would otherwise not have been identified.  The Guatemala's BOS covers 13 common services organized into the following outcome areas:
Common Administration services including common Facilities/Premises
Common Finance services
Common Human Resources services
Common Procurement services

BOS 2023 REVIEW:
Guatemala OMT still continues its efforts in creating collaborative work, through different operational, high-impact and cross-sectoral activities, such as PSEA, Gender Parity and Disability.

In 2022, the UN in Guatemala began the “Return Plan” with a hybrid work and a total return in December when de WHO reported the end of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Due to this, the Agencies project a 30% increase in operational expenditure compared to 2022.

For 2023, a cost avoidance of USD1,417,783 is projected, considering the normalization of the Agencies operations in the following lines: Travel, Vehicle Rental, Conference and Event Management

The Agencies that project a greater cost avoidance for the use of the services are: UNICEF, UNOPS, WFP, UNHCR.

Due to the positive result obtained in 2022, more Agencies have been interested and have joined the collaborative work to reduce costs. "
GUY;Guyana;346;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The United Nations System in Guyana is constituted of some 22 Agencies, Funds and Programmes. Twelve entities are currently resident in the country (FAO, IOM, UNAIDS, UNDP, UN Women, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNDSS, RCO, WFP and the World Bank).

In 2019, as part of plans to realize more effective business operations, the majority of UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes with a field presence in Georgetown relocated to a common premises. In 2020, working as part of the Operations Management Team (OMT), ten agencies, Funds and Programmes in Guyana embarked on the formulation of a new Business Operations Strategy (BOS). Participants committed to providing an OMT Focal point and subject matter experts to support the effective planning and execution of the BOS implementation plan.

In 2020, the BOS for Guyana determined to explore the establishment of eight `Common Services 'across three Service Lines (Administration, Procurement and ICT). 

At the time of the present 2022 BOS Annual Review (March 2003), a total of four common services had already been established: cleaning services, hygiene services, garbage collection services security services (all in 2021) and, under `Administration` service line, pest control services (in 2022).

Looking ahead, for 2023, the OMT has committed to assess the establishment of a further ten new common services.

These services are catering; venue rental and conferencing facilities; local travel; mobile phone services; internet connectivity; fire equipment maintenance, video editing; common ICT applications, mapping of disability inclusive venues (Level 1 Access); enabling environments (Lactating Spaces).  

Assuming all are taken forward, this would take the total number of common services established since initiation of the BOS to 18.

When the BOS was initiated in March 2021, the total estimated cost avoidances through implementation of 8 new common services was calculated at US$ 591,433 for the period 2021-2026.

With the completion of the 2022 Annual Review (March 2023), the revised BOS estimates cost avoidance through implementation of the same 8 common services at US$ 517,231 over the period 2021-2026.The difference is accounted for by one Agency opting out of one of the selected services.

Implementation of an additional 10 common services (from 2023 onwards) may yield additional cost avoidance. However, the new common services may require implementation costs. Any implementation costs associated with newly- identified common services must be added to the US$ 5,490 `carried over ` from 2022(i.e. planned implementation common services scheduled for 2022, but which did not take place)."

The Business Operation Strategy (BOS) is a key component of the UN reform and so of the efficiency agenda that seeks to enhance the quality and cost effectiveness of joint business operations at the country level in order to generate efficiencies to better support the 2030 Agenda.

Honduras developed its BOS as a timely response to the UN Secretary General vision to reposition the UN development system and the recommendation to identify ways to enhance cooperation, collaboration and coordination with the purpose to reduce transaction costs and demonstrate operational efficiency by eliminating the duplication of processes within business operations; leveraging the common buying positions of the UN; and maximizing economies of scale.

The Honduras BOS primarily focuses on improving linkages between programmes and operations, quality of services, operational focus and priority setting, efficiency gains and cost reductions. By promoting the collaborative work, the BOS seeks to reduce transaction costs and to achieve cost savings on externally sourced goods and services.

The COVID-19 pandemic enhanced the need to support these mechanisms of coordination among the agencies and the commitment of the UNCT and OMT members at all levels. The quality of the support to the business operations is critical for programme delivery and in-country office operations. The One Business operating model provides to the Country Teams with an outline for strategic and cost effective common operational support to the implementation of the programmes by capitalizing on existing agency operational capacities and enhancing service provision activities. The Business Operations Strategy has proven to be a highly valuable tool for the One UN in Honduras. It has allowed for the conceptualization of opportunities and substantial cost reductions, as well as efficiency gains that would otherwise not have been identified. The Honduras BOS considered 14 common services organized into the following outcome areas: Common Administration services including common Facilities, Common ICT services, Common Logistic Services and Common Human Resources Services. The BOS intended quantitative impact is to reduce transaction costs (cost avoidance) by 6% by the end of 2025 (baseline recurrent cost USD 12.1MM). The cost avoidance on labor represents 51% for the period 2021 to 2025; this is strong evidence of the Reduction of workflow processes (which are duplicated in the agencies) by providing the service through a single channel, and not in a decentralized way at the agency level.

Emphasis is made on the need to incorporate the mutual recognition clauses in the Agencies' legal frameworks (contracts and purchase order conditions) in line with GA resolution 71/243, which calls for entities within the UN development system to operate according to the principle of mutual recognition of best practices in terms of policies and procedures, with the aim of facilitating active collaboration across agencies. 

During the 2021 BOS 2.0 annual review exercise for Honduras, the projected costs for the years 2021-2025 were reviewed considering the prevailing conditions in 2021 such as: the work from home modality due to COVID19, the ETA and IOTA hurricanes emergency response projects, and the Presidential elections, which all together may have hindered the initial programmed activities and assumptions made for the period. Despite the conditions, for the first year of the BOS implementation in Honduras, the OMT registered an annual cost avoidance of USD 66,807.00, achieving 97% of the original projected amount of USD 68.7K for the year 2021.

In order to keep consistency with the calculations for 2021, the OMT members agreed on the following criteria to be considered in the BOS 2.0 annual review exercise:

1.      Based on the assumption that the AFPs work under a collaborative LTA, we will have a better negotiation advantage due to the effects of economies of scale. We are aiming on achieving at least 10% reduction of the service cost.
2.      The total annual expenses will be divided by the procurement threshold of each AFP, to determine the number of processes that should have taken place.
3.      For future labor costs, the OMT have agreed to use UNDP´s UPL 2021 as price reference. Additionally, it was agreed that when working collaboratively the labor costs would be divided among all the participating agencies.

       The OMT agreed to discontinue the fuel management service as providers are not willing to sign an LTA contract due to constant price fluctuations, preventing the establishment of a joint initiative. Nonetheless, the OMT will continue seeking opportunities to include this service in the future if feasible. Additionally, the OMT agreed to discontinue the recruitment process of consultants and interns, as this service require further analysis. During 2021, the OMT continued piggy bagging with WFPs LTAs for the services of accommodation, vehicle rental and printing, registering a benefit of USD 95,458.00 of cost avoidance representing the 58% of the estimated cost avoidance for year 2021, saving process costs and time to the participating agencies.

During the BOS review exercise 2022, the OMT had the chance to review the 5-year projections and the overall criteria for the CBA calculations, considering the accumulated experience from the past 2 years working under the efficiency agenda framework, and the back to office new working conditions after the COVID pandemic. The criteria applied for the BOS review exercise 2022 is as follows:

1.      OMT will continue working under the assumption that 10% reduction of the service cost will be achieved as result of economies of scale in collaborative LTA procurement processes.
2.      OMT members agreed that the frequency of the processes would be understood as the number of purchase orders processed during the year, as applicable to each agency. 
3.      The total annual expenses will be divided by the procurement threshold of each AFP, to determine the number of processes that should have taken place. However, this condition is not applicable for all the agencies, therefore, OMT agreed that these criteria will be considered only if it applies.
4.      For 2022 future labor costs, the OMT have agreed to continue to use UNDP´s UPL of year 2021 as price reference in the CBA, considering that UPL prices for 2022 appear lower than in 2021, which does not reflect the reality.
5.     OMT agreed that for year 2022, the labor costs cannot be divided among all the participating agencies because the cost of LTA is assumed completely by the leading agency, plus there is still no agreed cost recovery mechanism in place.
6.     Starting 2022, UNDSS and RCO will participate and register data individually, and will no longer participate together under “UN”.
7.     Common services for Security and Cleaning were included in the CBA of each agency, separated from “Common services”.

One of the important changes applied in the BOS platform in 2022 is the restricted and individual access to enter data in the platform for each participating agency, resulting in better accountability on behalf of each Agency. 

After completing the BOS review for year 2022, Honduras reported a benefit of $263,139.00 reflected as cost avoidance, reaching 87% of the estimated goal for the year of $302,303.00. In order to achieve the estimated goals for the remaining years, the OMT agreed to continue strengthening efforts towards the joint collaboration, promoting greater involvement of the participating agencies in the establishment of new joint LTAs.

HTI;Haiti;347;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Business Operations Strategy 2.0 (2020 – 2026)

2022 marked the end of the One UN Plan 2020-2022 aligned with the Government’s Plan Stratégique de Développement d’Haïti (PSDH) 2012-2030. The United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Haiti developed Business Operations Strategy (BOS) 2.0 (2021 – 2026) to coordinate and align its operations for more efficient and effective service delivery, thereby avoiding duplication of processes, reducing transaction costs, and enhancing operational efficiency, allowing the UNCT to benefit from economies of scale.

The Business Operations Strategy (BOS) is a results-based framework that focuses on joint business operations with the purpose of eliminating duplication, leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN and maximizing economies of scale. BOS 2.0 (2021-2026) was developed through the BOS online platform in early 2021. It will go through an annual monitoring phase. The BOS focuses on common services that are implemented jointly or delivered by one UN entity on behalf of one or more other UN entities. Common services for future collaboration were identified in the areas of Common Administration services, Common Finance services, Common Human Resources services, Common ICT services, and Common Procurement services.

The following UN organizations are participating in the BOS 2.0 (2020-2026) in Haiti: UNAIDS, FAO, ILO, IOM, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNOCHA, UNOPS, UN Women, WFP.

The UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator is accountable to the Secretary-General for the development, implementation, monitoring and reporting of the BOS 2.0 and steps towards a Common Back Office (CBO). The UNCT provides overall oversight of the BOS 2.0 process, approval and release of necessary UN organizations and joint resources, sign-off of the final BOS 2.0 and annual reporting. The Operations Management Team and its subsidiary bodies are responsible for facilitating development and implementation of the BOS at the country level. The Development Coordination Office (DCO) is responsible for coordination, guidance and support to UNCT and UN RC/ HC on the BOS 2.0.

The BOS 2.0 (2021 - 2026) has been prepared in a highly consultative process with the input of various UN entities in Haiti with the goal of supporting effective program delivery, monitoring and evaluation and reporting on common operations. Consultations with the OMT and its technical working subgroups were undertaken to calibrate the level of performance with regards to their key operations functions. The BOS 2.0, therefore, underlines key priority areas arising from these discussions strengthened by a detailed operational analysis and provides the short and medium-term strategic results that will guide the monitoring and evaluation of operations in the above-mentioned common service areas during the implementation.

Being a living document, the BOS 2.0 (2021 – 202) will be implemented and operationalized through six OMT strategic Working Groups (Administration, Logistics, Human Resources, Finance, Procurement, ICT) under the guidance of the OMT to support joint planning, monitoring, and reporting for results. Inter-agency activities to be implemented in aforementioned areas will strive to improve cost effectiveness, quality, and efficiency of the UNCT’s support to program delivery and business operations. Implementation of the BOS 2.0 is expected to result in net cost avoidance of USD 3,668,213 through harmonization of business operations over the 5-year period of 2021-2026.

The BOS annual review 2022 was conducted under the leadership of the chair of the OMT (WFP) with the support of the regional focal point. The security situation during 2022 has had an impact on the agencies' operations. However, the expected results of the BOS could not be fully achieved. In addition, the mobilization of focal points to take part in this exercise and provide quality data was a real challenge. Based on UNCT consultations; some entities (BINUH, RCO, UNV, UNEP) were removed from this review process due to a lack of data. Some Common Services identified in 2019/21 are non-relevant anymore (after few years later) given the evolving situation that led agencies to adjust their functioning modalities. Finally, UNHAS considered as a global common service has been removed from the current review.

The BOS 2022 annual review revealed avoided costs 2019 to 2022 of USD 447,395 on all services.

For 2023 priorities, the UNCT in Haiti will strengthen its efforts to reinforce the OMT secretariat in support to the chair, innovation, common premises, environmental sustainability, gender and disability inclusiveness and other elements in support progress towards Agenda 2030 as part of the BOS 2.0 (2021 - 2026). Staff well-being would also be crucial for efficient and effective attainment of the set objectives.

Different trainings opportunities must be beneficial to OMT members. To support effective and efficient delivery of the UNSDCF the OMT will work through the relevant Working Groups recommended through an internal evaluation of common services."
IDN;Indonesia;403;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Within a decade Indonesia will become one of the world’s leading economies. Its large and youthful population of 266 million people makes it the fourth most populous country in the world and one of the world’s largest democracies. Allied to that, Indonesia’s extensive maritime state of over 17,000 islands, possessing a rich cultural, environmental and biodiversity, make it a land of extra-ordinary possibilities. There are 20 UN agencies committed to support government Indonesia to achieve its Sustainable Development Goals.

Business Operations Strategy (BOS), as strategic planning instrument of The Operating One Pillar, is a framework guiding UN business operations at the country level which is used as a flexible tool to enhance the cost-effectiveness and quality of joint business operations. BOS facilitates the strategic planning, management, monitoring and reporting of the UN Country Team (UNCT)’s joint activities and achieve

OMT Indonesia reviewed the progress of all outcome areas (Admin & Logistics, Facilities services, Finance, Human Resources, Information Communications Technology and Procurement) and made adjustments/revisions where necessary. The BOS start date indicated in the BOS 2.0 online portal is the initial review date bringing the originally launched BOS up to date covering years from 2019 - 2024 to make sure that the document is a living strategy. 

Through various collaborative approach and common services, UN Indonesia is aiming to avoid approx. USD4.2M roughly of which is cost avoidance is from common finance, ICT, procurement, logistics and human resources areas, and common Administration services including common facilities and premises.

During 2021 BOS Annual review the office has been able to complete majority (78%) of key activities. It is noted some of activities were delayed due to restriction of mobility caused by COVID-19 pandemic. However not all the key activities are triggering benefit to all participating agencies as planned. Some of them has internal agency arrangement that hinder to get the benefit. During the implementation of BOS, office also identified 13 new initiatives that were added into BOS.

During the BOS QA process, it was found out that there are opportunities to increase the efficiency rate by changing methodology in calculating benefit. This review will be done during 2022 reporting cycle.

During the 2022 BOS annual review, the office has been able to complete 83% of key activities. To ensure the timeliness of the annual reporting, BOS Champions facilitated meetings of OMT WGs. Revisions were made by each agency adhering to the new supplemental BOS guidelines, notably major changes from 3 agencies previously under the UN and now has been disaggregated into UNS-RCO, UNS-UNDSS and UNS-UNDGC. Annual review also revealed some activity lines that do that bring benefits as projected. During the implementation of BOS, the offices also identified new initiatives that will be added to 2023 BOS."
IND;India;402;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The UNCT and OMT in India is pleased to present the Business Operations Strategy (BOS) framework that aims to enhance the agility of business operations by removing constraints to coordination and cooperation and thereby simplifying cross-agency service delivery and enabling deeper forms of collaboration and integration to stay relevant to the changing needs of operations development in India.

The BOS in India captures 26 Common Services across 5 Common Service Lines: Common Administration services, Common Finance services, Common Human Resources services, Common ICT services and Common Procurement services. In the BOS 2021 cycle we were able to achieve the cost avoidance of approx. USD 4.6 million across the common services and aiming to achieve an additional cost-avoidance of approx. USD 5.8 million by 2023.

Some of the key highlights of the above-mentioned common service lines are listed here:

1. Common Administration services:
In 2021, a new common premise was established in Kolkata. Preliminary discussions are ongoing for establishment of Common premises in two other states of India by 2022.  The efforts and commitment of the task force has led to attainment of the status of “Certified Green Building” for UN house by India’s indigenous rating system. The AWG is further targeting to achieve international certification on green building i.e., LEEDS for UN House by 2022 to ensure and promote environmental sustainability of UN premises.

The OMT is committed to facilitate and promote sharing of vehicle assets (ONE UN Fleet) between agencies located in common premises by 2022.  Moreover, UN House and UNICEF New Delhi office premise are made largely accessible for differently abled persons. OMT is working together to map all the premises in India to understand better accessibility status in all office premises across India so the necessary interventions may be instituted by 2022.

The OMT has developed Air Pollution SOP to provide guidance and directions to the agencies on management of their business operations especially during the polluted part of the year depending upon the risk profile.

Efforts are made to finalize SOPs for all UN agencies in India on the Protocol handbook, a comprehensive information manual on various processes relating to Protocol and issues related to it.

2. Common Finance services
Finance Working Group (FWG) is committed to work with Banking Partners to maintain high quality services for corporate and staff transactions. Agencies continued to work through GST consultants selected through common UN bidding process with the GST department to expedite GST refunds to UN Agencies. LTA for filling IGST refunds was also established though joint UN procurement process.

FWG will continue to be engaged in 2022 consulting services to interpret some of the provisions of the GST Law and until today some of the provisions are not clear and the negotiations are still on-going.

3. Common Procurement services
PWG had created LTA for Security Service, Courier, Printing House Keeping and event management during this period and taking a lead on developing joint LTAs on many other operational areas in 2022

4. Common Human Resources services:
The Human Resources Working Group's (HRWG) activities encompassed common training and capacity development opportunities in line with BOS requirements with an orientation towards strategic HR Management and Business Partnering approach. The HRWG was also instrumental in engaging Medical Doctors and hiring of counsellors in a timely manner to respond to COVID-19 health challenges faced by UN personnel in the country.

 The staff wellbeing and training initiatives sensitized all India UN staff on PSEA/ Inclusion and aligned HR processes through safer recruitment practices, detailed background vetting including behavioral aspects & safeguarding PSEA. Knowledge Sharing among HR to promote vacancy announcements in various networks of agencies to have inclusive hiring methodology for disability & gender.

5. Common ICT services
The ICT working group (ICTWG) worked jointly on common issues that emerged in the areas where the UN could achieve significant values. This includes connectivity agreements with vendors; mobile services for all UN agencies within India; Leasing options for various ICT equipment (Multi-Function Printers) and Mobile Phones; and Help Desk Support Services through outsourcing.

ICTWG is focused on creating a common data management system for the OMT WGs to create a space where members can access to information and files related to OMT activities. This Yammer platform eased the process of information dissemination among participating agencies.

ICT WG is committed to bring technology as enabler to bring efficiency in all activities of the OMT

The BOS for UN in India, which started on 2020, has been reviewed by OMT during the first quarter of 2022. All mandatory annual reviews, regular reviews and updates will be carried out by the OMT with regular reporting to the UNCT on progress. In the event that there are significant changes in the plans or changes in the context or the potential opportunity to include more common service areas within the cooperation framework, the BOS will be revised/updated to address the changes.

The BOS in India will be the key living document for Business Operations Improvement, Consolidation and Innovation in line with the overall UN Efficiency Agenda

IRN;Iran;404;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"UN Iran’s Business Operations Strategy (BOS) is developed to contribute to one of the key pillars of the UN Secretary General’s reform agenda – namely, the repositioning of the UN development system. Together with other system-wide initiatives, such as Common Premises (UNCPs), BOS constitutes a critical tool to help increase efficiencies, improve quality, and reduce unnecessary costs for the UN Country Team and its constituent agencies, funds and programmes. BOS 2.0 has four important features that are worth highlighting:

Practical. Avoiding duplication, exploring economies of scale, and leveraging the bargaining power of ‘One UN’.
Gradual and flexible. BOS 2.0 adopts a step-by-step approach and allows room for adjustments over time. 
Complementary. BOS 2.0 connects well with other streams of UN development reform – including corporate initiatives to strengthen UN Common Premises and Common Back Offices.  
Client-oriented. BOS 2.0 is driven by the need to be responsive to its direct clients - namely individual UN agencies, funds and programmes operating in Iran. 
The following summarizes the key elements of the strategy:

A. OBJECTIVE: To improve the efficiency of operations across the UN in I.R. Iran – by avoiding costs, simplifying business processes and improving the quality of operational activities. Ultimately, the intent is to enhance the impact of the UN in I.R. Iran – by improving the quality of the UN’s work through ‘smarter’ inter-agency collaboration.

B. METHOD: Strengthen existing common services and introduce new common services – which capitalize on economies of scale, joint ‘negotiating power’ and minimizing repetitive and duplicative processes.

C. KEY TARGETS:
It is expected to avoid approximately USD 1,000,000 in cost of operations through the enhancement of existing and new shared services during the period 2020-2025.
Increase client satisfaction by an average of 25% against the baseline.
Support UNCT’s efforts in achieving the SDGs through undertaking High Impact Common Services including Gender responsive procurement, disability inclusive procurement and HR practices, physical and digital accessibility of the UN in Iran, carpooling, and energy consumption, measurement and monitoring (ECCM).
D. KEY ACTIONS & ACHIEVEMNETS 
Procurement: The on-line vendor databases is maintained and validated and includes markers for businesses that are either managed or owned by women as well as persons with disabilities. New long-term agreements (LTAs) for Ambulance Services during the Medical Evacuation and Internet Connectivity services are established.
NOTE: It is worth mentioning that on Internet Connectivity services, participating entities have managed to negotiate a 36% reduction in the unit price for Mb/month. This reduction is not shown in the “realized benefit” in 2022 since the LTA was established in later part of the year and many entities did not have the opportunity to use it. We expect to see larger amounts of cost avoidance in 2023 and 2024.

Admin and Logistics: In this service area, joint procurement of services such as security, travel and customs clearance is being undertaken. More services such as car-pooling and joint procurement and maintenance of security equipment will be considered in 2023. A number of activities related to environmental sustainability and accessibility are also being undertaken.  
Finance: Tax management (for applicable tax exemptions and refunds), enhanced HACT management, joint negotiations with banking service providers and enhance internet and mobile banking options for UN agencies are being implemented.
ICT: Joint Helpdesk services and digital accessibility are among the activities being undertaken.
Human resources: Strengthened collaboration on common ‘Duty of Care’ functions, including through joint negotiations with health providers to continue to strengthen the quality of their services to UN personnel and dependents, Gender Parity, staff wellbeing and HR inclusive practices are among common service being implemented in this service line.
Through above joint activities, the country team has achieved USD600,000 in actual financial benefits from 2020 to the end of 2022.

Furthermore, several common services are dropped from BOS, since the services in question do not yield significant cost or quality benefits. Even though they will continue to be provided, they will not be included in BOS. They include, among others, Financial Services, Lease Management and Cleaning services.  

UNCT's commitment to BOS activities were commendable in 2021 and 2022. They not only committed considerable staff time by participating in regular Working Groups meetings but also cost shared a consultant to assist the OMT in the implementation of BOS 2021 and 2022 workplan. 

Sanctions continue to create major challenge for UN operations in Iran and the implementation of BOS workplan, especially in procurement of imported goods and international services such as banking. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the pandemic has created opportunities for moving towards greener UN offices and operations. Some of these opportunities include Car Pooling and Fleet management which, will be explored and implemented in 2023 and beyond.  "
IRQ;Iraq;349;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"In January 2023, Iraq’s Operations Management Team (OMT), in line with the “efficiency agenda”, initiated the BOS Annual Review aiming at consolidating business operations while supporting more effective programmes.

The productive collaboration of UN AFPs in the areas of administration, finance, HR, ICT, logistics and procurement, contributed in 2020, 2021 and 2022  to align efforts and maximize system efficiencies, despite the complex environment in which the UN family operates in Iraq. The country hosts a special political mission (UNAMI), which acts as the main service provider for the UNCT because the security situation does not allow normal market alternatives.  UN staff in some duty stations, including Baghdad, are embedded in facilities operated by UNAMI, and the UNCT is often required to use UNAMI-managed housing, transportation, offices, and other services. 

Significant progress was achieved against the annual targets set within the Results Framework. More specifically, in the spirit of increased economies of scale, reduced transaction costs, agility and improved relations with contractors several steps have been taken to carry out Common Procurement Actions, including joint solicitation to leverage buyer power to achieve rates and prices that no single organization could obtain individually, thereby increasing value for money for all participating parties. In this regard, several tenders were jointly prepared by the Procurement, Admin, Finance and ICT Working Groups: “conference and event management services”, “customs clearance and exemption services”, “travel management services”, “in-land transportation services”, “contract management for banking services” and “internet services” have resulted in LTAs contributing to an overall cost avoidance of USD 502,459.

Out of the 29 service’ lines jointly identified in the 2020 BOS, several services have been implemented and scaled-up, including vehicle maintenance, parking services, VHF improvement plan. During the review, achievements, bottlenecks and delays have been discussed and priorities set for 2022; as a result, new common services have been identified and few discontinued. Currently, 23 services lines have been confirmed.

A total of USD $ 1,142,374 is estimated as the total cost avoidance (this cost avoidance includes the one-time cost + the recurring cost + the labor cost). This number was computed from the BOS online platform, where the total CBA is outlined.  It is important to note that the component of quality improvement is also recognized under the Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) for each of the common service in the quality-dedicated area.

The difference between the 2020 “projected” 7 million and 2022 cost avoidance is due to incorrect data entry, and discontinuation of some services. As an example, the projected costs avoidance for the logistic services in 2020 amounted to USD 3 million, while in 2022, all services were discontinued as it was not possible to have a common approach. The concerned services will be reviewed by the Logistic Working Group in 2023 and if feasible, included in the 2023 Annual Review. Additionally, USD 2 million projected cost avoidance from “Conference and event Management” was reduced to USD 220,000 in 2022 based on the “realized” cost avoidance in 2021.

The BOS 2.0 is now complete in the platform and has been reviewed and endorsed by the Quality Assurance (QA) focal appointed by the Regional Coordinator’s Office, and the OMT has the approval and commitment from the UNCT to support the human staff time) and the financial resources in supporting the BOS budget of approximately $ 235,080. 

It is expected that the agreed services will contribute to the more harmonized, qualitative and efficient UNCT operations in Iraq."
JAM;Jamaica;350;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Operationally, UN Jamaica continues to move towards collective operational efficiency with the full implementation of the online Business Operations Strategy (BOS). The implementation of high impact common services in Finance, Human Resources, ICT and Administration across the system is expected to generate high cost avoidances, quality improvements, promotion of good practices, & advancement of the 2030 Agenda. During 2022, the Operations Management Team (OMT) underwent considerable changes even as several agencies were undergoing post-COVID-19 recovery phase.  The departure of several long-standing members also put a particular strain on collaborating on common operations within some agencies. However, in spite of these challenges, the OMT has managed to continue to deliver on collective results, which included the drafting of two interagency LTAs and road mapping towards a UN House in Jamaica.

During 2022, the OMT focused on four specific Service Lines; Common Administration, Common Human Resources; Common Finances and Common ICT. During this period, UN agencies in Jamaica collaborated on courier services and , cleaning services (for co-located agencies), , travel services, mobile phone services and in financial services for the HACT-implementing agencies.  The realized benefits from collaboration increased by 46% from $99,016 in 2021 to $144,096 in 2022.  The analysis showed that the top three high-impact services over the next five years will be within joint staff training services, travel services and mobile phone services. It is further anticipated that the estimated total benefits from implementing common services across the UN Jamaica will increase to $567,998 over the next five years.  Whereas no new common services are planned for 2023, the main focus will be on strengthening inter-agency collaboration, capacity building of the OMT and fast-tracking the development of joint frameworks that is already underway.

Subsequently during 2023, finalizing the LTAs for courier service, cleaning services and stationery provision (led by FAO) will be a priority while other LTAs on travel (led by IOM) and mobile phone services (led by UNFPA) will also be renewed. No new services will be introduced in 2023. The OMT in collaboration with the UNCT will explore increasing the number of resident Agency, Funds and Programmes (AFP)s who occupy the UN House. It is envisaged that co-location will provide benefits from common service consolidation.  A Comprehensive Local Salary Survey will be rolled out in 2023 under the newly implemented ICSC methodology under the guidance of the Local Salary Survey Committee. A Cost-of-Living survey is also scheduled to be conducted in 2023, with results to be published in the final quarter of the year. Additional efforts are centered around the provision of adequate well-being mechanisms, including “counselling and stress management services” will be undertaken."
JOR;Jordan;351;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"In 2023, Jordan will sign the Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for 2023-2027 that includes three overarching, inter-linked priorities: Inclusive Green Growth and Decent Work; Social Protection and Quality Basic Services; Sustainable Management and Access to Water, Food, and Energy; Accountability, Transparency and Participation Empowering People, and Expanding Opportunities.  

The Business Operations Strategy (BOS) platform provides the mechanism for the UN to realize efficiency gains and quality enhancements to support UN goals and objectives. Across the UN in Jordan, collaboration is underway in five common service areas: Administration; Finance; Human Resources; ICT and Procurement. Within the agreed service areas, the UN in Jordan has prioritized several common service activities. Many collaborations are a continuation of existing provision, while a few other collaborations are scaled up. Successful implementation of the BOS in Jordan is expected to reduce the administrative burden by reducing redundant processes, improve service quality, and minimize the cost where applicable. The UNCT endorsement to this annual review exercise reveals the strong commitment to the OMT and OMT working groups working on the BOS five service lines and reiterating on supporting the area of collaboration highlighted in the Jordan BOS requirements and its implementation plan. 

Priorities in each of the five areas include those that need to be scaled- up, discontinued, or modified to fit the country's priorities and the existing human capacities that can run the indicated collaborations. 

Administration: The Administration Working Group has shifted its focus towards promoting teamwork and concerted efforts to tackle the challenges and difficulties encountered by UN agencies in Jordan. By adopting a harmonized approach in coordination with the RC office, the group has been successful in resolving various significant challenges, including taxation, residency, and entry visas, as well as other administrative areas. Furthermore, the WG has been able to secure the best travel agents and accommodation rates through common LTAs. The group is currently seeking appropriate implementation tools and mechanisms to consolidate all UN efforts. Updating the current SOPs in compliance with common actions is one of the top priorities for the year. The group plans to conduct monthly meetings with all protocol focal points from UN agencies to discuss processes, pending cases, and common obstacles and difficulties. Additionally, the WG aims to harmonize the approaches of UN agencies with the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Interior to standardize processes for optimal benefits through the RC office. Finally, the group is working to consolidate the efforts of all UN agencies in resolving the issues faced by Yemeni staff outposted in Jordan.  

Finance: Improving the cost-effectiveness and quality of financial services is being pursued by negotiating favorable rates for banking services and ensuring unified banking fees across UN entities dealing with the common banks. Unifying individual approaches to tax refunds and exemptions, in line with HACT principles, conducting HACT audit and Micro-assessment for common Implementing partners among UN and spot checks on financial transactions are also included to improve cost-effective and enhance the quality of financial services. 

Human Resources: Several areas of cooperation have been identified to reduce processing time and costs, as well as to improve the quality of support provided to staff. UNDP continues to lead the annual salary surveys and provide payroll services for several UN entities. UN-wide vacancy postings will support wider outreach to increase applicant pools and rosters; organizational culture and gender parity. Joint onboarding includes a focus staff well-being and on Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA also to foster Disability inclusion and Youth Participation among UNCT. 

Information Communication and Technology (ICT): The 2023 will focus on accelerating common Knowledge platform and on data telecommunication infrastructure. LTAs for internet and mobile phone services will continue to achieve significant savings and to improve the quality-of-service provision.? Similarly, an LTA and accompanying SOPs is planned to support sustainable disposal of IT equipment / supplies. The ICT working group will work on procurement of ICT and network hardware. 

Procurement: The Procurement working group supports the OMT by facilitating the contractual agreements for all entries that have a procurement nature under the approved OMT action plan."
KAZ;Kazakhstan;417;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The UNCT in Kazakhstan is comprised of the following agencies and programs: ILO, UNOHCHR, UN Women, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNESCAP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, FAO, UNDRR, UNODC, UNRCCA, WHO, UNV, IOM, UNEP, UNGDC, UNDSS and the RCO. The majority of UN entities in Kazakhstan are housed in the common premises located in two cities, Astana and Almaty.

In 2020 the new UNSDCF for 2021-2025 was developed. The programme was developed in consultation with the Government of Kazakhstan and sets the strategic vision and direction for programmatic activities of the UN agencies working in the country. The same year the UNCT adopted the Business Operations Strategy which was aimed at effective support to the programme implementation through application of DELIVERY AS ONE APPROACH. In line with the requirements of the UN Efficiency Agenda the country BOS is focused on achieving operational efficiency via simplification and harmonization of the business practices and finding new opportunities for further collaboration.

During the BOS Annual Review that took place in 2022 the OMT has revisited the list of selected common services, reassessed the potential for cost avoidance, and based on the recommendation of DCO added new services provided under the common premises arrangements in both locations.  

The Annual Review process is revolved around the following principles:

- Improved effectiveness and cost-efficiency and enhanced transparency and accountability
- Simplification and harmonization
- Prioritizing the operational outputs and activities based on impact and complexity with focus on high impact/less complex interventions
- Finding new opportunities beyond operational procedures and discovering new ways of working together effectively to achieve both individual agency and shared organizational goals

In addition the BOS provides a summary of estimated costs required to implement the activities outlined in the results framework. The objective is to ensure more effective delivery of results and do more within the recognized resource constraints through innovation, cooperation and change management initiatives. "
KEN;Kenya;418;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The 2022-2026 United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) for Kenya is the UN’s commitment to supporting the development aspirations of Kenya and its people articulated in Kenya’s Vision 2030 and the 3rd Medium-Term Plan (MDP) and the Big four agenda.

The UNSDCF was developed under the leadership of the Government of Kenya following the principles of UN Delivering as One (DaO). It is the collective response of all UN agencies working in Kenya and is focused on areas in which the UN Country Team (UNCT) is best positioned to contribute.

In Kenya, over 45 UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes are present under the Common Services governance framework, including significant regional presence, humanitarian and peace-keeping entities and headquarters of UNEP and UN-Habitat. In addition, non-resident agencies, especially the Somalia-based offices, which, although not directly involved with the BOS Kenya, have a relationship with it regarding activities within Kenya. This presents a significantly large, cost-effective and collaborative business operations model, which aims to eliminate duplication and overlap in service provision, leverage the standard bargaining power of the UN and maximise economies of scale.

Within this context, the Common Services Management Team (CSMT) in Kenya developed a new Business Operations Strategy (BOS) for 2020-2024, approved by the Resident Coordinator on 30 July 2020. The BOS for Kenya has 42 service lines and outlines critical aspects for inter-agency harmonisation needed for effective delivery of the UNSDCF while keeping in line with Agencies policies and procedures and the operational/common services baseline. Carpooling, Green Energy, Conferencing and sustainable procurement are among the high-impact common services we continue to work on.

The BOS remains guided by the UNCT and the CSMT and has a common objective of conducting how the UN in Kenya delivers more coherent, effective and efficient support to implementing UNSDCF and providing common services in line with the SG’s efficiency agenda.

Common services for ongoing collaboration are in the areas of Common Finance services, including HACT (8 service lines), Common Human Resources services (13 service lines), Common Procurement services (13 service lines) and Common ICT services (10 service lines). Joint interventions in these common service lines focusing on cost-effectiveness, enhanced quality with operational focus and prioritisation are projected to generate a total cost avoidance of around US$ 20.8 million in 2020-2023 (3 years). In addition, the CSMT in Kenya incorporated innovation, sustainability, gender parity and other elements in support of the SDGs into this current BOS.

Since 2020 there have been achievements realised under the BOS, which can be highlighted as follows:
- Common Finance, including HACT: Securing exemptions for VAT for all UN agencies, funds and programmes in or operating from Kenya. Undertaking a comparative analysis of banking LTAs for UN agencies to identify variations in charges levied on UN agencies and the possibility of harmonisation. Joint spot checks have also been undertaken within the HACT for better qualitative and quantitative outcomes
 
- Common Human Resources: Strong focus and support to enhance gender mainstreaming and gender equality across UN agencies, funds and programmes. An additional service line in relation to the inclusion of persons with disabilities is under consideration.

- Common Procurement: LTAs were established for accommodation and conference services, vehicle insurance services, vehicle maintenance services and provision of Stationery items. The training focused on embedding environmental sustainability in procurement and increased collaboration through mutual recognition and utilising other agency contracts seen across UN agencies despite operational constraints.

- Common ICT: Increased advocacy and collaboration in activities like the decommissioning of a satellite in block J located in the UN Gigiri Complex, which was successfully completed and the promotion of “Greening IT” services received a boost after two e-waste agreements from WFP and UNON were finalised and made available for use by all UN agencies.

In 2021, the Administrative Working group was created under the CSMT. This group saw much interest and uptake from participating agencies. The key priority service lines included in the BOS review under administration include:

- Common Premises: The co-location of one or more UN agencies present in Kenya within a common premises established at national or field levels managed by a lead organization and supported by a range of common services to harmonize common operations within the country.
 
- Environmental Sustainability: Promote collective energy efficiency aspirations in greenhouse gas emissions; waste management; air pollution; water and wastewater and biodiversity degradation.

- Fleet Management: Provide sustainable mobility solutions that are efficient and effective for official transport needs through digital taxi services, carpooling etc.

To achieve great success in this inter-agency Framework, the CSMT in Kenya continues to undertake other initiatives as enablers to support the BOS process:

Monitoring and Evaluation: Despite being a working group under the CSMT, the M&E working group doesn’t have specific service lines under the BOS due to its cross-cutting nature. in 2022, M & E working group assisted in reviewing the work plans of the other working groups to ensure M & E principles were followed for better monitoring and measuring of results and impact.

The Governance and Accountability Taskforce (GATF) of the CSMT (OMT) was constituted in 2021 to improve the efficiency of the CSMT and its working groups with particular attention to the membership of the groups, active participation and recognition for members by their specific entity. A document is now ready for review by the CSMT and subsequent endorsement by the Resident Coordinator, which would then be submitted to all heads of entities to build on successes that would further strengthen the operating context of the CSMT, its groups and to acknowledge the contribution of members at the CSMT.

Mutual Recognition: To promote and solidify the Mutual Recognition (MR) application in UN Kenya, the CSMT agreed to form a Mutual Recognition Working Group in 2021. A survey was conducted in 2022 to determine the current MR knowledge level and how the entities apply the MR principles. Next will be to develop Mutual Recognition guidelines for the UN Kenya focusing on service areas within the UN Kenya BOS towards supporting Common Back Office implementation.

In 2022, the total budget for BOS in Kenya was USD 108,000.00 and the participating UN agencies have contributed this amount. However, only some budgeted activities were conducted in 2022; the remaining will be done in 2023. The UN entities continue to work towards better economies of scale and efficiencies."
KGZ;Kyrgyzstan;353;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The need for harmonization of business operations within the United Nations (UN) system was identified many years ago. In 2011, the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) followed up with the report of the Secretary-General on simplification and harmonization of the United Nations development system (E/2011/88). The report stated that simplification and harmonization in the United Nations development system have made considerable progress over the past three years. Within existing rules and regulations, a large number of innovations were initiated at the country level, leading to tangible efficiency gains and cost savings. Lessons learned informed inter-agency guidance, which is increasingly country driven. The report also mentioned that there is limited scope for experimentation at the country-level without commensurate adjustment of headquarters procedures and practices, to be decided at the headquarters level. Procurement and human resource management are seen as the priority for simplification and harmonization. Underlying the different business practices are different business models, which respond to organization-specific mandates and programme activities guided by governing bodies. Evidence shows that there is potential for simplification and harmonization within existing business models, for example, in procurement and human resources management. Stakeholders should take a staged approach, first striving to achieve the utmost progress without major structural transformations and showing quick wins, efficiency gains and savings.

In this backdrop, the Business Operations Strategy (BOS) serves as a framework which allows UN Country Teams (UNCT) to take a strategic, results oriented approach to planning, management and implementation of Common Business Operations at the country level. BOS outlines how common UN operations will support the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) implementation. Kyrgyzstan Business Operations Strategy (BOS) 2019-2021 is a medium- term prepared by the Operations Management Team (OMT) to support implementation of the UNDAF 2018-2021 and the following UNSDCF. It focuses on benefits and opportunities arising from the inter-agency collaboration. This exercise is a result of joint work of members of the OMT in close collaboration with UNCT led by UN Resident Coordinator.
 
Kyrgyzstan BOS 2019-2021 aims to achieve more effective and cost- efficient support services by reducing duplication of functions and administrative and transaction costs and enhancing inter-organization partnership at the country and global levels. It focuses on areas which could contribute the most to cost avoidance and quality improvements, especially in common administration services, procurement, HR and finance/HACT. The common administration services include conference and event management, travel services, vehicle rental, fuel management, interpretation and translation services, etc.

Fourteen UN agencies participated in BOS Annual Review 2021. The services identified are those that relevant to the country context and to the participating agencies. The collaboration covers four BOS identified service lines: Administrative services, including commo premises, Finance services/HACT, Human resources and Procurement, and 17 specific common services. The total budgeted cost avoidance for the period ending 31 December 2021 was US 3,2 mln while the realized cost avoidance was US$ 1,5 mln. The difference between planned and actual figures are attributable to COVID-19 slowdown of program activities, political unrest in 2020 and the presidential elections in 2021. Currently the internal political and socio-economic environment is stable in the country, therefore no disruption of UN activities is foreseen.

 Of the total cost avoidance, the main portion of the amount relates to Common administrative services and use of common Long-Term Agreements (LTAs) for travel services, fuel, event management and management of common premises. Other service lines are relatively smaller, but the OMT is exploring opportunities for further collaboration to increase efficiency of operations, reduce staff cost and increase quality of services.


The annual reporting and BOS update started in March 2022 by OMT with the subsequent periodic quality checks by RDCO, Istanbul.

2023 Annual review update:
In 2022 budgeted cost avoidance amount was $569k. The actual cost avoidance figure is $439k, that is 77% of the budgeted amount. The difference can partially be attributed to external factors listed below.

1) Russia-Ukraine war that resulted in huge inflation rate and difficulties in import/export and other activities. Some procurement activities were delayed/cancelled/reprogrammed.
2) Kyrgyz-Tajik border armed conflict in September 2022 followed by political tensions was another external factor that greatly affected UN activities. Some events were cancelled/postponed.

For the 2023 Planning framework there are no major changes to the composition of BOS agencies, BOS Services lines/categories and costing methodologies.

KHM;Cambodia;320;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;" The United Nations in Cambodia committed to introduce the Business Operations Strategy (BOS) on 04 March 2020. The BOS is the steppingstone for enhanced concerted efforts in the area of operations for UN entities in the country. The OMT has worked collaboratively to identify common service lines to be included in the BOS. Fourteen (14) UN entities are participating in the current BOS. In this context BOS is expected to accelerate the existing collaboration between UN entities, reduce further operating costs, improve the quality and access to services, enhance the quality of data monitoring, eliminating duplication of processes and increase possibilities of economies of scale.
 
The current BOS includes eleven (11) common services, where administrative services occupy a large share with eight (08) common services, two for the finance sector and one for the ICT services. The update total cost avoidance for the five-year period (20-24) , as at March 2023, is estimated at USD 1.87 m, with realised benefits up to 2022 at USD 0.97 m. This represents an appreciable level of cost avoidance for the UN entities which will be mostly used in the implementation of programme. This indeed will free time for staff to focus on other areas that will benefit UN entities. As regards the improvement of quality services, the utilisation of common benchmarks, indicators, terms of reference and monitoring of services will greatly enhance the control on services being provided.

The risks for the implementation of the BOS have been identified, as well as the assumptions that will enable the UN entities to achieve the set results. The implementation plan will pave the way for a structured approach in the monitoring of the BOS and support the achievement of the objectives. The introduction of the BOS will create synergies between UN entities’, and it is expected that this will create more avenues of cooperation and instrumental in transitioning to Common Business Operations.

As of March 2023, the BOS Annual Review was initiated by the OMT. This included a comprehensive review of participating agencies, OMT/UNCT/BOS members, the opportunity analysis, update of activities completing and planned in 2022 and a review of the planning framework. The initial BOS Annual Review was submitted on 22 March 2022 for quality assurance.

As per the review from the OMT all the existing service lines are to be maintained for 2023. The UNCT has during its retreat in February 2023 decided to include additional service lines among which “Gender Parity”, “Environment Responsive Procurement Sourcing”, “PSEA”, “Car Pooling”. These will be included after a review by the OMT during 2023 and proposals made to the UNCT for approval."
XKX;Kosovo;405;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Harmonisation of business processes for greater efficiency, reduced operational transaction costs, and decreased duplication of operational support to programme delivery by the United Nations system has been continuously called for by the General Assembly. The United Nations system agencies in Kosovo have a BOS strategy in place and it has been revised. The impact of United Nations programmes in Kosovo is reliant on the effectiveness, efficiency, and cost of the operations that support them. Over time, the United Nations development system agencies are likely to deliver with better quality and lower cost business operations, with more resources remaining within the programme budget.

Although the functions of facilities and events management, logistics, human resources, and ICT are identified as core functions for mainstreaming, under the BOS 2021 as such, a number of the services under the BOS have been removed as a consequence of the 2022 review process. For instance, most of the ICT services have been removed due to launch of the UNall ICT services; some ICT services will, however remain eg related to the local provision of help-desk support. In addition, some of the HR and Finance services had to be removed from the list due to the bilateral agreements between UN Agencies. The revised BOS for 2022, will continue to focus into the strategic framework for the collective efforts of the United Nations system, reflecting the areas for strategic cooperation, collaboration and partnering to achieve common goals, principally through joint programming and collective advocacy.

The BOS review objectives as per the existing guidance are presented in the following section:

Cost reduction:
- Reduction of duplication of work processes at the agency level by providing the service through a single channel, rather than decentralized at the agency level
- Reduction of transaction costs (time spent on activities) for the UN and partners, including the host government, due to harmonized operational procedures and standing agreements with vendors
- Enhanced leverage of UN bargaining position when procuring goods in larger quantities

The quality enhancement will be achieved by jointly procuring services in larger volumes, the UN increases its bargaining power with the service provider and enhances its ability to monitor and evaluate overall quality of service delivery of that service provider. 

The reviewed BOS 2022 will enhance operations by focusing on prioritization of the Business Process that are light, easy to use tools to identify and prioritize high impact harmonization initiatives and facilitate monitoring and evaluation of harmonization initiatives against pre-established baselines.

When reviewing the BOS, the Operations Management Team reviewed the potential for reducing transaction costs by analyzing the average time dedicated by agency staff to procurement of commonly used goods and services and calculating savings for those procurement activities for which common LTAs can be established.

Data analyses of the existing and ongoing LTAs for interpretation and translation services, fuel supply, travel services, taxi transportation, accommodation services, conference and event management have made it possible for the participating UN agencies to get more qualitative and reliable services at reduced costs and with less staff time involved. In addition to ongoing services the OMT agreed to establish LTA(s) for conference and event management. 

The current common premises was beneficial due to cost-sharing for rent and for the services of reception, cleaning, electricity, security, and maintenance. The existing common premises also enables more frequent exchange of information and partnership building among the UN agencies, thus contributing to development of effectiveness and synergies in programme interventions. 

Although, Kosovo has been chosen as piloted for a common premise, and will pursue the establishment of UN House, due to COVID – 19 pandemic had to slowdown perusing this request, although number of attempts have been made to establish new UN House. Changes on market and price increase are some of the factors that have slowdown this process, specially taking in consideration that establishment of the New UN House at this point may initially require substantial investments to make these premises safe and secure as per UN standards.

KWT;Kuwait;352;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"In general, the Business Operations Strategy (BOS) serves as a framework that guides the UN business operations at the country level. It facilitates strategic planning, management, monitoring, and reporting of the joint support provided by UN Country Teams (UNCT) to program delivery through common business operations. This approach helps support the delivery of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) while enhancing the cost-effectiveness and quality of joint business operations.

GA Resolution 71/243 stipulates that UN entities should operate according to the principle of mutual recognition of best practices to facilitate active collaboration across agencies while reducing transaction costs for governments and collaborating agencies. In line with this, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has encouraged all UN country teams to ensure compliance with an improved Business Operations Strategy.


The BOS is part of the ongoing reforms in response to the UN Secretary General Reform Agenda. It enables UN agencies to harmonize their business processes using a structured framework that reinforces the principles of results-based management in joint operations. The BOS reflects common services developed jointly and does not replace individual agency operations plans. The focus is on reducing the staff time it takes to carry out processes by streamlining or simplifying the process and reducing direct costs.

The BOS also helps in cost avoidance, where actions are taken to avoid future costs, freeing up resources for implementing program initiatives. These actions can be monetary, such as direct cost savings in joint procurement initiatives, or non-monetary, such as quality enhancements of services or reduced lead times for processes resulting in less staff time involved in executing a process.

In 2019, the BOS was launched in Kuwait before the UNSCF for Kuwait was finalized and signed. Consequently, the Kuwait OMT developed a focused BOS with a smaller subset of common services related to operations service lines provided to the UN organizations located at the UN House. The main target was to help avoid unnecessary costs through better coordination, consolidation, and harmonization of five selected outputs/service lines, namely procurement, finance, human resources, ICT, and admin.

In 2023, eight UN agencies located under one roof at the UN House in Kuwait, namely UNRCO, UNDP, UNHCR, UNHABITAT, ILO, IOM, WHO, and UNICEF, agreed to continue collaborating on the BOS. As of April 2023, the UNSCF was still not finalized nor signed, so the BOS in Kuwait will continue to focus on the  service lines related to the UN House operations.

Through the BOS steps, namely Stock Take, Opportunity Analysis, Cost-Benefit, and Prioritization, the OMT in Kuwait identified the priority service lines for 2023 to be Common ICT and Common Administration Services. 

Accordingly, the eight collaborating agencies agreed to work together on internet connectivity, operations and security telecommunications services, security services (guards), and cleaning services (cleaners). The result of having the eight UN agencies operating at one location ""UN house"" and collaborating in four service lines for 2023 is estimated to have total cost avoidance of $220,000."
LAO;Lao PDR;406;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The Business Operations Strategy articulates the shared vision and common strategic priorities of the UN Country Team in Lao PDR for 2017 – 2021 in five key areas of business operations: procurement; human resources; information and communication technologies; finance; and logistics and facility services, including common premises.

2022 Annual Review's statement (ARW)
The review was conducted in the last implementation year of the current cycle of BOS. The main purposes of the review are to evaluate the implementation of the agreed common services under the BOS 2.0. and report on utilization of the benefits realized and the quality enhancements achieved from the collaborative operational services.  By evaluating the efficiency gains realized from the joint activities under each OMT sub-working group, the members will be able to assess the relevance of each operational collaborative priorities to the programmatic priorities to decide on their continuity and identify new opportunities for additional joint operational priorities under BOS cycle 2022-2026.


Outcomes of the BOS Annual review
- Data on cost saving for the common services lines of Common human resources services, finance services, procurement services, ICT services, logistics services and administrative services, including common premise, was populated in the system.
- Prior to the kickoff of the BOS review process, the members of the OMT and OMT sub-working groups received a face-to-face training session and series of webinar by the Regional BOS focal point. The OMT and OMT sub-working group members also benefited from the Daily Helpdesk Hour organised by the regional colleagues. Thanks to these supports, the BOS review process was smooth and effective.
- The BOS review exercise shows a total cost avoidance USD 310,000 for 2022;
- The outcomes of the BOS Review acknowledge the continuation of the on-going common services lines for their cost-efficiency gains. "
LBN;Lebanon;354;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;" I am pleased to present the revised UN Country Team’s Business Operations Strategy for the  period 2020 – 2023. This Business Operations Strategy translates the UN Country Team priorities in the areas of common operations for 2020 – 2023 into innovative activities. By adopting this Strategic Operations Framework, the UN Country Team in Lebanon confirms its commitment to managing their support to program delivery more efficiently, avoiding duplication of work and getting the best value for money.

This Business Operations Strategy builds on ongoing efforts by the UN Country Team to harmonize and simplify its business operations. In its development, the BOS 2.0 reflects 6 common areas: admin, ICT, procurement, HR, finance and logistics;  and ensures cooperation in 42 common services the majority of which will be scaled up moving forward.

The aim of this Business Operations Strategy is to further improve the quality, timeliness, and cost-effectiveness of our operations resulting in cost avoidance since working as ONE allows for joining of resources. This cost avoidance is different to savings as it is not reflected in terms of financial gains in budget but rather leads to less recurrent and labor costs.  It is estimated that as a result of its full implementation over its four year cycle, cost avoidance of over $3.6 million will be achieved as net benefits through efficiency gains in material & service procurement, labor costs, as well as from expense savings. The realized benefit is $1.6 million for the period of 2020-2021. It is worth mentioning that the majority of the avoidance is a result of common admin and ICT services particularly travel, and internet.

It is the responsibility of the managing agency  of each common service to achieve the yearly planned targets at the implementation level in close coordination and collaboration of the designated working group.  It is the responsibility of the OMT to monitor the implementation plan as endorsed by UNCT.  

By adopting the Strategic Operations Framework, the UN Country Team is marking its commitment to the simplification and harmonization of the UN’s business operations and the achievement of better development results in Lebanon. Furthermore the UNCT in Lebanon considers this Business Operations Strategy an important step towards common back office for Lebanon commissioned  by the Secretary General.

We in the UN Country Team are happy to join the group of UN Country Teams who have already adopted the BOS framework in support of the UN reform, and we aim at improving further the lives of people in Lebanon."
LBR;Liberia;407;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"It is my pleasure to present to the UN Country Team the New Business Operations Strategy (BOS 2.0) of Liberia for five years commencing 2019 until 2023.  

The United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Liberia formally launched the development of a new Business Operations Strategy (BOS 2.0) in February 2019. BOS 2.0 is a successor to the previous BOS 1.0 that ended in 2019 and builds on the ongoing efforts by the UN Country Team in Liberia to harmonize and simplify its business operations and support implementation of the UNSCDF and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development.

The Business Operations Strategy (BOS) is a results-based framework that focuses on joint business operations with the purpose of eliminating duplication, leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN, and maximizing economies of scale. It is facilitated by the principle of mutual recognition, and it constitutes a reliable evidence-based foundation for the establishment of common back offices. BOS 2.0 is also a critical instrument to advance the UN Secretary General’s vision on business operations reform requiring all UN Country Teams to have a BOS in place by 2021, specifically requesting the UN System to enhance the quality of existing and future Business Operations Strategies. In addition, we are discussing the full implementation of a CBO/LSSC by 2024 and by then, we shall have achieved four out of the five targets laid out in the BOS Reform document.

Out of the Twenty-One (21) agencies present in Liberia and projected for collaboration, the following twelve are the currently collaborating agencies in one or more common services in the new BOS 2.0 for Liberia: UNS-RCOs, FAO, IOM, UNS-DSS, UNDP, UNFPA, UNS-OHCHR, UNICEF, UN WOMEN, WFP, WHO, and UNESCO. However, UNS-UNODC is our newly opted agency that has expressed interest in joining the collaboration and data will be incorporated in the next review cycle of the BOS. However, during 2022, there were two agencies (UNOPS and UNIDO) that left the ONE UN House thereby rendering them as non-collaborating. UNAIDS also closed its operations in Liberia in July of 2022 and so there is no data info for the period under review.

The Liberia BOS is structured around the following five common service lines that will bring efficiency, cost effectiveness and quality improvement: Finance including HACT (4 common services), human resource management (10 common services), procurement (3 common services), information and communications technology (4 services) and administration including facilities management (26 common services) the majority of which has been scaled up. In relation to the just mentioned, the HACT category common services have been labelled as “further analysis require” as a way forward. This is mainly due to the UNCT inability to collaborate, and this action will suspend the common services cost avoidance potential in the BOS, though these common services are HICs and highly recommended.

The CBA analysis also indicates that the Management of Common premises, Printing services, Vehicle rental, Travel services, Internet connectivity and VSAT services, Vehicle maintenance, and Stationery procurement contribute the highest cost avoidance to the UN system in Liberia over the BOS period for five years (2019-2023).

The overall impact of the BOS in terms of projected cost avoidance was estimated to be $3,516,113 USD over the period (2019-2023) of the BOS. However, the annual review has now been analyzed and found that the realized cost benefit until 2022 is $2,550,379 USD. Relatively, the just mentioned common services contribute to 63.2% of the total realized cost benefit so far. 

BOS Liberia is also contributing to the High Impact Common Services and SDG Impact Common Services such as Environmental Responsive Procurement, Environmental Sustainability of common premises, Disability Inclusions, and Gender Parity, etc. and such services will facilitate for the quality improvement of the common services in Liberia. In this vein, out of the Fifty-Four (54) specially marked High Impact Common Services (HICs) in the BOS 2.0 platform, the Liberia UNCT is collaborating in Twenty-One (18) and plan to take up more in future.

In additions to the above, the UN system in Liberia is also collaborating in several other areas such as banking services, cash transfer for meeting participants using mobile money, energy consumption, measurement and monitoring, joint Business Continuity Plan, common meeting room and registry Services which are not included in the CBA but are contributing towards the quality of our business operations and efficiency gains.

However, there are challenges which include:
- The release of spaces to the landlord by UN agencies in the One UN House due to reduction of staff; financial instability; and absence of some UN agencies that vacated the One UN House
- Source of power – the One UN House has been unable to connect to the city grid and the current breakdown of commonly used generators

Executive Summary"
LKA;Sri Lanka;412;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"TThe United Nations in Sri Lanka has successfully implemented the second generation of Business Operations Strategy (BOS) framework for years 2018- 2022. The BOS Review for 2022 concludes the final year of this cycle.

UNCT Sri Lanka unveiled its UNSDCF 2023- 2027, in late August 2022. The United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for 2023–2027 articulates the collective vision and contribution of the United Nations system to support Sri Lanka to accelerate actions towards the achievement of the SDGs.

The operational context for UNCT in Sri Lanka also changed drastically since the beginning of 2022. Sri Lanka defaulted on its USD 46bn debt in April 2022, which spiraled into the worst economic crisis the country has seen since its independence. The economic crisis precipitated a humanitarian emergency in the county that required UNCT to respond by enacting a joint Humanitarian Needs and Priorities (HNP) Plan, which called for US$47.2 million to provide life-saving assistance to 1.7 million people worst-hit by the economic crisis over a four-month period, from June to September 2022.

September 2022 recorded the highest year-on -year inflation rate change in the National Consumer Price Index which was recorded at 73.7% and a year-on-year food inflation rate which was recorded at 85.8%. According to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan Rupee depreciated by nearly 45% against the USD during 2022.

Set against this background of increasing costs and operational activity amongst most agencies at the country level, the UNCT and OMT worked together to ensure that the dividends of common services are realized across agencies.

As per the data submitted by UNCT, the Total Realised Benefit for UNCT Sri Lanka for 2022 stands at USD 324,326. This is an increment from the total realized benefit of USD 238,153 that was recorded for year 2021.

Based on the UNSDCF and as well as various consultations that were carried amongst the different working groups, two key areas were prioritized for common services for year 2023. Gender Inclusion and Disability Inclusion is a cross cutting area that multiple working groups have prioritized for 2023. Most common services from 2022 will continue to be in operation for Year 2023 as well, along with the additional common services identified on the key priority areas identified above.  

For year 2022, the OMT was supported by the OMT Secretariat with an annual budget of USD 18,909 cost shared by the agencies. The OMT Annual Budget was increased to USD 20,660, this increment is due to increasing costs and additional OMT activities such as an OMT Retreat. A larger component of the budget is allocated for the operationalization of the OMT Secretariat and not the amount allocated towards the operationalization of common services. Where funds were allocated towards common services, it was reflected accordingly under the planning framework.

The document has been developed in accordance with the United Nations Development Group (UNDG) guidelines and based on Results-Based Management concepts and approaches. It outlines all aspects of the process of development of BOS for 2023, including principles of implementation, details of operations analysis, description of results framework and budgetary requirements, and mechanisms of governance and monitoring and evaluation.

LSO;Lesotho;355;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The United Nations Country Team (UNCT), in collaboration with the Operations Management Team (OMT) and its Working Groups, has developed a comprehensive Business Operations Strategy 2019-2023 (BOS2) to support the delivery of the Lesotho United Nations Development Framework 2019-2023 (UNDAF). The BOS2 is a medium-term strategic plan that aligns with the Delivering as One (DaO) approach and aims to provide efficient and effective support services to the UNDAP through inter-agency coordination and cooperation on support service functions.

The BOS2 has the potential to achieve significant economies of scale, with results dependent on the UN development system's ability to increase efficiency and establish common business systems, policies, and procedures. The BOS2 focuses on monetary savings, reducing transaction costs, and increasing operational efficiency in support of Lesotho UNDAF 2019-2023.

The BOS2 prioritizes common services that are implemented jointly or delivered by one UN entity on behalf of one or more other UN entities. The identified areas for future collaboration include Common Administration services, which encompass common Facilities/Premises, Common Finance and HACT services, Common Procurement and Logistics services, Common ICT services, and Common Human Resources services.

Several UN agencies are participating in the Lesotho BOS2, including RCO, UNDP, FAO, IOM, UNDSS, UNAIDS, UNFPA, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO. Non-Resident UN agencies, such as ILO, IAEA, ITC, UNV, UNCTAD, UNECA, UNCDF, OHCHR, UN-Habitat, UNODC, UNEP, UNIDO, UNWTO, UNWOMEN, UNESCO, and UNHCR, are also involved in the implementation of the BOS2.

Overall, the BOS2 provides a strategic roadmap for the UN development system in Lesotho to work together effectively and efficiently, maximizing resources and efforts towards achieving the UNDAF goals.

The BOS 2 comprises five Service Lines

1.	Common ICT services
The UN in Lesotho has established a set of objectives for their Common ICT services, focusing on achieving cost-effective and dependable internet connectivity within the compound. One of their key goals is to reduce connectivity costs by 15% by negotiating with ISPs as a group. They also aim to enhance business continuity and disaster recovery to ensure resilience in connectivity. Another objective is to create a knowledge management platform accessible to all UN groups.

In 2017, the UN in Lesotho successfully installed an IP-based telephony system, resulting in a 20% reduction in telephone communication costs. By 2022, the UN in Lesotho had accomplished significant milestones, including the procurement of a cloud-based helpdesk system, live streaming services for meetings, additional access points installation, and CCTV camera rehabilitation. Nonetheless, the UN in Lesotho has faced some obstacles, such as individual agencies conducting their own Business Continuity Plan (BCP) exercises and retreating from common arrangements. There is also a need to improve their ICT infrastructure to support outdoor activities and hybrid meetings.

To address these challenges, the UN in Lesotho has identified various priorities for 2023. These priorities include developing a collaboration platform that is accessible to all UN groups, adopting green ICT practices to reduce their carbon footprint, providing cost-effective landline phone services, and enhancing the quality and reliability of live streaming services for meetings and events.

The UN in Lesotho's Common ICT services plays a crucial role in supporting their overall objectives. By focusing on cost-effectiveness, dependability, and accessibility, they aim to achieve efficient and effective ICT services that support the UN's work in Lesotho.

2.	Common Administration and Premises Services
The UN in Lesotho is dedicated to maintaining cost-effective and high-quality Common Administration and Premises Services. This includes premises management, catering, cleaning, security, reception, and maintenance of various building systems. They aim to make the UN House more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly by adopting various measures such as installing solar panels by 2023 in line with the aspirations of SDGs 7, 12, and 13. The UN in Lesotho is committed to ensuring physical accessibility to UN premises, facilities, and meeting places for persons with disabilities by 2023.

The UN in Lesotho achieved several significant milestones in 2022, including the installation of solar panels on the third floor, which provides 35kwp of power, conducting an environmental sustainability assessment, reducing the use of plastic, and implementing an environmental monitoring system. However, the UN in Lesotho faced several challenges, including restructuring of Common Services, bottlenecks in the implementation of activities, and resource mobilization for projects.

To address these challenges, the UN in Lesotho has identified several priorities for 2023. These priorities include ensuring the environmental sustainability of common premises, installing phase 2 of solar panels, measuring and monitoring energy consumption, installing solar streetlights around UN compounds, ensuring level 2 physical accessibility, managing common premises and plants, and implementing fleet management and carpooling. To address human resource requirements for facilities management, the UN in Lesotho has proposed the creation of two positions, which were approved for consideration under the 2023 budget.

The UN in Lesotho is committed to maintaining high-quality Common Administration and Premises Services while also addressing environmental sustainability concerns. Their efforts to reduce their environmental impact using solar panels and the reduction of plastic use are commendable. The proposed creation of new positions for facilities management will help address human resource requirements and ensure that the UN in Lesotho can continue to provide high-quality services.

3.	Common Procurement and Logistics Services
The Common Procurement and Logistics Services of UN Lesotho aim to reduce procurement expenditure by 15% while maintaining quality services and effective logistics arrangements. This is achieved through the establishment of new joint LTAs, common vendor databases, and capacity building of UN staff and local vendors. In addition, the services aim to improve stationery and printing quality and delivery time, as well as reduce hotel costs. Logistics services provide freight forwarding, custom clearance, warehousing, and distribution services. UN Lesotho has achieved several common LTAs, including catering, office stationery, internet, generator maintenance, fire equipment maintenance, and emergency medical services. However, the absence of a procurement officer in 2022 has posed a significant challenge for monitoring the execution and performance of LTAs and daily procurement activities. The proposed solution under the 2023 budget is to create procurement officer positions. The Common Procurement and Logistics Services will develop common LTAs for printing and graphic design, advertising local media, mobile call and data contracts, and videography and photography. They will establish a Common Supplier Roster and a Common Procurement Team to enhance service delivery.

4.	Common Finance Services
The Common Finance Services provided by UN Lesotho aim to manage risks, reduce transaction costs, and promote sustainable development through coordinated procedures for requesting, disbursing, providing assurance, and reporting on funds. In 2022, the service completed 14 spot checks and 5 audits related to the Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfers (HACT). However, the service faced a challenge in incorporating HACT activities into the Finance Working Group (FWG), which only includes finance staff from all agencies. This left out the program component of HACT, making it irrelevant for non-HACT finance focal points who are members of FWG.

To address this challenge, the service recommended refocusing the FWG's work by enhancing reporting and monitoring of common budget expenditures and resources mobilized in a timely manner and providing a quarterly report to UNCT (United Nations Country Team) for information and decision-making. The Finance Working Group (FinWG) will audit the report before submitting it to UNCT quarterly. Additionally, the service recommended separating HACT and Finance and reviewing and clarifying proposed roles and responsibilities at UNCT.

The Common Finance Services also finalized and endorsed the budget for 2023, and the Chair of the Operations Management Team (OMT) is requested to present the budget and Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to UNCT for approval.

5.	Common HR Services
The Common HR Services in Lesotho have achieved several significant milestones in 2022, such as conducting a salary survey, creating a harmonized induction package, and conducting training for staff in psychosocial support and PSEA. It's also commendable that the Common HR has identified gaps in UN HR practices concerning disability inclusion and is working towards making HR processes more friendly for disabled individuals.

However, the challenges faced by Common HR, such as lack of participation in PSEA and difficulty in coordinating meetings, need to be addressed to ensure effective service delivery. The Common HR's recommendation to include its members in the PSEA network and discuss globally the pending consequences of SC salary scale issues is a positive step in the right direction.

The priorities outlined by the Common HR for 2023, such as monitoring the annual salary survey process, harmonizing the local vacancy advertisement process, organizing sensitization sessions and PSEA trainings, and reviewing HR processes to be more friendly to disabled individuals, are crucial for ensuring coordinated and efficient HR management in Lesotho.

Overall, the Common HR Services in Lesotho are focused on promoting staff well-being, inclusion, and professional development, which is essential for creating a healthy and productive work environment.

The UNCT in Lesotho is projected to save approximately USD 1,210,105 over the UNDAF cycle from 2019 to 2023. These savings can be utilized for various programmatic initiatives and to improve the overall quality of business operations. Efficient management of resources is crucial for achieving Sustainable Development Goals and promoting sustainable development. It's encouraging to see that the UN in Lesotho is taking steps towards cost-effectiveness while maintaining quality services."
MAR;Morocco;420;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Le repositionnement du Système de développement des Nations Unies prévoit une réforme du dispositif fonctionnel au niveau des pays dont la première étape encourage une plus grande collaboration entre les agences parties au Plan-cadre de coopération pour le développement durable en vue de la mise en place d’une stratégie relative aux activités de gestion et d’appui (business operations strategy ou BOS).

La BOS est un cadre de résultats et de planification conjoint qui engage les agences signataires à renforcer leur collaboration afin d’améliorer la qualité de leurs services de gestion et d’appui opérationnels, et de réaliser des économies de coûts permettant d’optimiser les fonds qui leur sont confiés pour la mise en œuvre des activités programmatiques. La BOS vise à éliminer les doublons, à tirer parti du pouvoir de négociation conjoint, et à faire des économies d’échelle, tout en améliorant la qualité des services fournis.

La BOS 2.0 s’appuie sur une méthodologie renforcée et sur une plateforme en ligne. Afin de favoriser l’exécution efficace des plans-cadres de coopération et des composantes du Programme 2030 de développement durable, le Secrétaire général a demandé à toutes les équipes de pays de mettre en place la stratégie améliorée BOS 2.0 d’ici à 2021. Les agences, fonds et programmes participants à la BOS 2.0 du Maroc (2021-2025) sont : CEA, FAO, HCR, OIM, OMS, ONUFemmes, ONUSIDA, PAM, PNUD, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF et UNOPS rejoints par FIDA ET UNHABITAT en 2022. 

La Coordonnatrice résidente est redevable au Secrétaire général de l’élaboration, de la mise en œuvre, du suivi et du rapport annuel sur la BOS. L’Équipe de pays a fourni les orientations stratégiques, assuré la supervision générale de l’élaboration de la stratégie et sa validation, et mis à la disposition de l’OMT les ressources humaines et financières nécessaires. L’OMT et ses groupes de travail ont élaboré la stratégie et son plan de mise en œuvre. La BOS 2.0 du Maroc a été élaborée de manière participative, en étroite consultation avec toutes les agences participantes. Elle reflète les priorités identifiées lors des discussions, étayées par des analyses détaillées, et définit les résultats stratégiques à court et moyen termes qui guideront la collaboration entre les agences au cours des cinq prochaines années. 

À la demande de l’Équipe de pays, l’OMT a priorisé les lignes de services « Administration » et « Achats » en 2020. Quatorze services communs avaient été retenus, dont la mise en œuvre devait permettre des économies de coûts d’environ 1.895.011 US$ sur 5 ans pour un investissement de 107.840 US$. Les services « gestion de conférences et d’événements » et « interprétation et traduction » devaient générer les économies de coûts les plus importantes, soit 474.099 US$ et 457.945 US$ respectivement.

Des bénéfices qualitatifs sont attendus de la mise en place d’une base de données centrale pour les LTA et d’une seconde pour les fournisseurs, lesquelles faciliteront, via une plateforme unique, la collaboration en matière d’achats, l’économie de temps d’étude des marchés et ambitionnent de fournir, à terme, des services d’approvisionnement sensibles au genre et au handicap, et respectueux de l’environnement.

Les gains escomptés de la BOS 2.0 s’appuient sur plusieurs hypothèses, dont la disponibilité des ressources humaines et financières nécessaires à sa mise en œuvre, et l’engagement des agences de s’appuyer prioritairement sur les accords à long terme (LTAs) communs pour l’acquisition de biens et services.  Plusieurs risques ont été identifiés, dont le temps d’adaptation à de nouvelles méthodes de travail en collaboration et la faible réactivité des prestataires à répondre aux besoins.

La BOS est revue annuellement, et élargie à d’autres lignes de services et mise à jour, lorsque nécessaire, pour rester pertinente au regard des besoins de l’Équipe de pays et du nouveau Plan-cadre de coopération pour le développement durable 2023-2027.
 
Lors des travaux de l’OMT au titre de l’année 2021, l’OMT a décidé d’étendre le champ d’application de la BOS à deux lignes de services : RH et Finance sur recommandation de la UNCT.

Pour la ligne de service finance, l’analyse de l’existant a permis d’identifier les services communs liés à la HACT. Dans le cadre des nouvelles opportunités les services bancaires sont en cours d’analyse.
 
Concernant la ligne de service RH, aucun service commun existant n’a été identifié. Cependant, de nouveaux services communs seront identifiés dans le cadre de l’analyse d’opportunité.

La revue annuelle BOS 2 .0 au titre de l’année 2021 a permis de dégager les éléments suivants :

Contraintes :
La mise en œuvre de la BOS a accusé un retard considérable principalement dû aux conséquences de la pandémie de la COVID-19. Le mode de travail distanciel adopté pendant la pandémie n’a pas facilité les interactions entre les membres des groupes et a ralenti l’avancement des travaux.

- La non prise en compte lors de la planification initiale, pour les agences qui lancent pour la première fois un processus LTA, des délais importants de validation que prennent leurs bureaux régionaux et sièges
- La non-familiarisation des prestataires avec les procédures de soumission des nations unies et leur non-réactivité par rapport aux appels d’offres
- L’arrêt momentané des services communs en raison de la hausse généralisée des prix durant l’année 2021, qui n’a pas permis l’atteinte des objectifs en matière d’évitements des coûts annoncés pour la même année.

Etat de la mise en œuvre de la BOS
- Les travaux dans le cadre de la ligne de services « Achats » ont permis de sélectionner un prestataire de service pour le développement des deux bases de données.
- Les travaux dans le cadre de la ligne de services « Achats » ont permis de sélectionner un prestataire de service pour le développement des deux bases de données.
- La situation de la mise en œuvre des LTAs relatifs à la ligne de service administration se présente comme suit :
- Les services communs signés et utilisés en 2021 ( vehicle rental, translation)
- Les services communs signés et qui seront utilisés à partir de 2022 (security equipment procurement, graphic design services, et cleaning)
- Les services communs dont le processus d’appel d’offres est toujours en cours (interprétariat, hébergement et forfait séminaires, sécurité, services de voyages, impression, et gestion des conférences et événements)
- La hausse généralisée des prix depuis l’année 2021 a engendré l’arrêt momentané des services communs suivants : Fournitures de bureau et achat des toners.
- Les objectifs en matière d’évitements des coûts annoncés pour l’année 2021 n’ont pas pu être atteints.
- Les nouvelles estimations basées sur la révision des CBA s’élèvent à «1.540.000 ».
- La révision du taux de référence du dollar utilisé dans les CBAs : USD 1 = MAD 9.172 en septembre 2020 vs. USD 1 = MAD 9.499 en mars 2022 – impact : étant une diminution du montant en USD de l’évitement des coûts."
MDA;Moldova;376;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"At the request of the Government (2011), Moldova is a Delivering as One country which seeks to increase the United Nations system’s impact through more coherent programmes, reduced transaction costs for governments, and lower business operations costs. 

In 2022, the UN and the Government in the Republic of Moldova signed the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 2023-2027, which involved close collaboration and coordination with the Government of Moldova, as well as, a wide range of partners including civil society, academia, development partners, donors, etc.

The 2018-2022 UN Business Operations Strategy (BOS) has been developed by the RC and UNCT in Moldova to support the operationalization of the CF and provide a strategic, medium-term focus on common United Nations operations in support of enhanced programme delivery. The BOS focuses primarily on efficiency gains and cost avoidance through joint collaboration. It aims to enhance internal transaction cost avoidance and to improve the quality of services, including cost savings on externally sourced goods and services. The BOS is based on the existing corporate guidance, lessons learnt from the prior BOS and the needs emerging from the country partnership framework.

In this context, following a thorough review and analysis, aiming to identify solutions to existing bottlenecks in the UN operations, current BOS enunciates opportunities and cost benefits that have been identified in the common operationalization of the following five key service lines of business operations: Human Resources, Administration and common premises management, Finance, ICT and Procurement.

Currently, Moldova is facing the impact of the war in Ukraine and the continuation of the Refugees Situation following. To support the country in the crisis response, two new Agencies joined the UNCT, UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and World Food Programme (WFP) bringing their specialized knowledge and support. In this respect, LTAs currently established through OMT have been very instrumental to provide a rapid and cost-effective response.

Following BOS Annual Review, OMT has identified opportunities of collaboration in additional number of 5 common services, totaling 37 Common services under 5 Service lines. Additional opportunities identified are in the area of Common Premises management, Gender and Disability Inclusion, Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA), recruitment. The BOS annual review process provided also the opportunity to re-assess the currently existing common services. To be mentioned, that one additional UN Agency, and namely WFP and UNHCR, has joined the OMT, bringing experience and knowledge.

BOS has a strong focus on cost effectiveness and improved quality of services across the UN agencies and expected cost avoidance 2019-2025 constitute USD 1,033,153 for the period 2019-2025.

The OMT provides leadership on the implementation of a coordinated, efficient and effective common operational support agenda at the country level. It provides recommendations to the UNCT on common services and business-related issues and identifies opportunities for collaboration and innovation."
MDG;Madagascar;356;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"In his report to ECOSOC 2019 on the business development segment, the Secretary General reaffirmed that the ongoing UN Reform (in respect to resolution A/72/219) will yield a wide range of benefits. In the immediate term, this will take the form of alignment of processes, improved quality of analysis and reporting, greater transparency and cost avoidance. In the long run, the benefits will come in the form of faster and better progress towards the SDGs. The Business Operations Strategy (BOS) is UNDG's response to the results targets required by the General Assembly.

The BOS sets the medium-term strategic direction of United Nations country operations to support the implementation of UNSDCF. It reflects the high-level effects of Joint Operations of UN agencies (unlike operations at individual agency level) which identify expected results.

The objective of the BOS is the harmonization of the operational processes of the agencies, reduction of duplication and avoidance of transaction costs, development of synergies, improvement of efficiency and efficiency gains within the framework of ""Delivering As One"" to support the implementation of the UNSDCF, in a collaborative manner.

UN agencies have under the leadership of the RC finalized the UNSDCF (2021-2023) which has been signed with the Government of Madagascar. UNCT has mandated the OMT to elaborate the Business Operations Strategy that will support the programmes implementation. The BOS was collaboratively developed by the OMT, OMT working groups and PMT representatives starting from June 2020 under the leadership of the OMT Chair and in close consultation with DCO colleagues. Twelve agencies participate in the BOS: FAO, ILO, IOM, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNIDO, UNESCO, UN, WFP, WHO.

Based on lessons learnt from the BOS 2017-2019, reference to the final evaluation conducted by an independent consultant, the OMT and its working group members identified relevant and efficient services both from cost avoidance and quality improvement perspectives. All six service lines (Administration, Finance, Procurement, Human Resources, ICT and Logistics) have been retained and constitute the six outcomes of the BOS.

The BOS task force, together with the working groups undertook the different steps of the BOS process (stock take, opportunity analysis, costs benefit analysis and prioritization) which led to the identification of common services including new services with high impact through effectiveness and efficiency supported by a detailed operational analysis and provides the short and medium-term strategic results that will guide the monitoring and evaluation of operations in support to the programme delivery. The cost benefit analysis shows potential cost avoidance in the six service lines.

It is expected significant quality improvement and cost avoidance in the amount of USD  13.3 million over 5 years through mutual recognition, harmonization, synergy and collaboration.

The process ended with the results framework and the planning. Key indicators were identified to measure progress toward results.

MDV;Maldives;358;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"In line with the UN Secretary-General’s reform agenda to reposition the United Nations Development System, adoption of an improved Business Operations Strategy (BOS) is mandatory for all UNCTs with a global deadline of December 2021. The BOS is a results-based framework that focuses on joint business operations with the purpose of eliminating duplication, leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN and maximizing economies of scale. It is facilitated by the principle of mutual recognition and constitutes of a reliable evidence-based foundation for the establishment of common back offices.

The BOS for the Maldives applies to the areas of work most relevant to the UN Agencies operating in the country and is focused and structured around four service lines: Common Finance services, Common human resources management, Common procurement services, and Common ICT services.

The UNCT for the Maldives comprises of 15 UN entities. However, with a modest programmatic presence of the UN system in Maldives, majority of the UN entities that operate in Maldives are based outside of the country and provides support virtually. The operations of these agencies are conducted through the head office operating from another country, mainly either Sri Lanka, India or Bangkok.  As such the OMT membership for the Maldives constitutes of 5 UN agencies which conducts prominent operations within the country.

Under the strategic guidance and oversight of the UNCT, the OMT dedicated substantial human resources of the staff to complete the Annual Review of the BOS 2.0. Like development of the BOS the Annual review was a first experience and therefore considered as a learning process for the OMT members. Several dedicated series of discussions, supported by the DCO BOS focal points, and analytical exercises were required to complete the various steps leading to the quality review of the BOS implementation plan.

In line with recommendations of the BOS guidance on Monitoring Annual Review the OMT has reviewed the progress of agreed common services, discussed the existing bottlenecks, and agreed on way forward. The analysis showed that implementation of the selected services was heavily affected by COVID-19 pandemic and a respective additional workload on agencies. This resulted in the implementation rate of 20% as only two services out twelve planned were started/implemented in 2021: mental sessions for the UN Staff were arranged by the RCO as a part of the training activities under the Human Resources service line, and Macro assessment was initiated jointly by UNDP, UNICEF, and UNFPA in 2021. The annual revision exercise revealed necessity to postpone implementation of a joint recruitment panel service due to undergoing clustering of HR services. 

As a result of the review process the UNCT and OMT have agreed to continue implementation of the remaining eleven services in 2023 and assess the monetary efficiency gains and the quality of the implemented services in the next cycle of the annual review in 2023. 

The OMT reviewed the BOS Work Plan for 2022 and acknowledges the need to increase ambition for common initiatives in 2023.  To this end, new initiatives of carpooling has been added and the OMT plans to undertake detailed discussions in 2nd quarter of 2023 to revise the BOS implementation plan 2023 for Maldives."
MEX;Mexico;362;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The UN Country Team (UNCT) in Mexico is currently composed by 29 organizations, which includes 22 residents and 7 nonresident agencies. The cooperation framework between the Government of Mexico and the United Nations for 2020-2025 was signed. The new document, entitled United Nations Sustainable Development Partnership Framework (UNSDPF) is structured in four (4) areas of work that reinforce each other: i. Equality and Inclusion; ii. Prosperity and Innovation; iii. Green Economy and Climate Change and  Peace, Justice; and, iv. the Rule of Law, with two areas that are transversals to all of them: Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women, Girls; and, Migrants and Refugees People  

The UN Secretary General has outlined the need for UN to implement changes to pursue “more cost-efficient support services, by reducing the duplication of functions and administrative and transaction costs through the consolidation of support services at the country level…”. The efficiency reforms are directed to optimize the manner the UN do business operations today. The UNSDG Business Innovation Group (BIG)  has been asked to lead the implementation of the strategy to ensure the targets set by the SG are met.

The Business Operations Strategy (BOS) among other efficiency interventions such as Common Back office(CB), Common Premises (CP) and Regional and Global Shared Services Centers are to be implemented at country or regional level in the short term.   These interventions are supported by three key enablers: a.- Mutual recognition; b.- Client satisfaction principles; and c.- Pricing and costing standards.

The BOS is a framework guiding UN business operations at the country level. The BOS facilitates the strategic planning, management, monitoring, and reporting of the UNCT’s joint support to programme delivery through common business operations.

The BOS is a flexible tool recommended for UN Country Teams that seek to enhance the quality and cost effectiveness of joint business operations.

The BOS reflects common services that are developed jointly and does not include or replace individual agency operation plans. Common services within BOS do not need to be common to all agencies, but rather can be a common service shared by two or more agencies.

Efforts in Mexico to implement the BOS 1.0 goes back to 2016 where a BOS methodology training and further discussion and analysis were held. Due to a variety of reasons, such initial effort was not successful.

Based on such experience, with a proactive partnership between the current UN Country Team and the Operations Management Team, it was agreed in June 2020 to start the design and planning of the BOS 2.0 which now includes an online platform.

For such purpose, UNCT delegated to the OMT (chaired by two members of the UNCT) the preparation of BOS 2.0.  For such purpose, six (6) task forces were established for the following lines  a.- Procurement; b.- ICT, c.- Human Resources; d.-Finance; e.- Administration/Facilities; and f.- Logistics. Selected staff members from 15 participating agencies were appointed as members of the task force based on their area of expertise.

For this first stage of the BOS, 15 Agencies, Funds and Programs participated in addition to the OCR. There are various reasons why not all AFPs residents in Mexico do not participate; Some have a more regional presence than at the Mexico level, and others have reduced work teams

A Coordination Team of four members was the link between the UNCT, the  OMT, Task Forces and Technical Support.

The result of the BOS exercise is a product of active inter-agency collaboration, a consultation and approval process between the Coordination team and the OMT and review and approval by the UNCT. For this exercise the various task forces incorporate for discussion and analysis topics such as gender parity, green initiative and disable people and inclusion. 

Taking into account the current working conditions as a result of the pandemic and seeking that the execution of the BOS will take place gradually and in a coordinated manner, it was decided that this first stage would cover two years of planning and implementation (2021 and 2022)

During the annual review process for 2022, the period for all common services has been extended until 2025  and data uptated accordingly.

Due to the delay in implementing the common services and the complexity that arises from the staff rotation in task forces to follow up on relevant planning frameworks, the OMT decided not to include new services during the 2022 annual review exercise. We expected to have the first common services implemented during Q4 2022, so there is no-cost avoidance to report in 2021

At the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023, Mexico have been able to move forward and finished the common services detailed below:
1.      Green IT (2022)
2.      Security Services (2022)
3.      Insurance Services (2022)
4.      Interpretation and translation services (2023)
5.      Travel (2023)

Although some services have not been completed as planned, the OMT and the working groups have had Important progress on the Non CBA common services such as Tax services and Human Resources. For the case of TAX services it was decided to prioritize the review of the current regulation about Taxes requirements for national and international staff in Mexico, based on the convention on privileges and immunities. In regards to the Human resources services related to disability inclusion work has been focused on the identification of internal partners and relevant guidelines to implement the service.OMT decided to include one additional common service in 2023: Human Resources Survey related to the place to place survey that has been managed by the RCO and UNICEF with the participation of all Agencies.

In terms of cost savings, approximately 190k has been achieved so far and a projected USD 2.5 million for the next five years.

During the exercise 2023, plans are being updated and/or achieved and all CBAs and Quality KPI being reviewed and updated too."
MKD;North Macedonia;370;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"In 2021, the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in North Macedonia developed its Business Operations Strategy (BOS) in support of a more effective programme delivery of 2030 Agenda and UN development system reform.

BOS is a results-based framework that focuses on joint business operations in support to programme delivery, with the purpose of eliminating duplication, leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN and maximizing economies of scale. It is an essential, but flexible and voluntary tool for UNCT North Macedonia to support the implementation of 2021-2025 UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (SDCF).

Fourteen UN entities are participating in BOS North Macedonia – FAO, ILO, IOM, OHCHR, UNDP, UNDSS, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNODC, UNOPS, UN-RCO, UN WOMEN and WHO. The Strategy focuses on five common thematic areas: procurement, ICT, administration, human resources and finance.


For 2023, four common services will be added: environmental sustainability of common premises, mapping/engagement of organizations of persons with disability and mapping of disability inclusion HR practices, and stationary procurement.

At the time of BOS development, the full BOS implementation during this period was estimated to result in savings of US$1.1 million as net benefits through efficiency gains in goods and service procurement, labour costs, as well as from savings in expenses. This was adjusted to $1.3 million during 2022 and to $1.1 million during the 2023 review. The actual realized cost savings in 2022 amounted to $130,635 and are estimated at $286,078 for 2023.

 
Besides the cost avoidance benefits, joint services continue to contribute to a high service standard, time efficiency and flexibility, transparency in reporting and information on performance, and overall higher quality of service delivery.

The successful implementation of the BOS in the country will be achieved through a high level of commitment and support from the UN Resident Coordinator, UNCT, Operations Management Team (OMT) and joint efforts of operations teams of all UN entities.
 
OMT was further strengthened in 2022 – it meets monthly, represents all UN entities with operational presence in the country and increasingly serves for information exchange and alignment on all operational issues such as vendors, use and establishment of long-term agreements, alignment of consultancy and service rates etc."
MLI;Mali;359;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Résumé Exécutif BOS Finale (14/04/2022)

1. Dans le contexte d’une crise multidimensionnelle à laquelle s’est ajoutée la pandémie du COVID-19, la stratégie relative aux activités opérationnelles [en anglais : business operations strategy (BOS)] est élaborée et mise en œuvre au Mali dans la perspective d’une meilleure rationalisation et recherche d’efficience des activités opérationnelles des Agences, Fonds, Programmes et entités des Nations Unies. Le BOS vient en appui au Cadre de coopération des Nations Unies pour le développement durable (UNSDCF), document de partenariat pour la période 2020-2024 entre le gouvernement de la République du Mali et le Système des Nations Unies. Les résultats de UNSDCF sont organisés autour de trois axes stratégiques et Six effets :
Axe 1 : Gouvernance efficace et redevable pour une société en paix, juste et inclusive avec deux effets centrés sur :
- L’Etat de droit, la paix et la redevabilité des institutions publiques, des médias et une société civile exerçant des rôles et responsabilités pour une gouvernance efficace et inclusif et ;
- La résilience des populations face aux conflits afin qu’elles vivent dans un environnement de paix, de sécurité et respectueux des droits de l’Homme et des traditions positifs culturels ;

Axe 2 : Croissance inclusive, résiliente, et durabilité environnementale avec deux effets visant :
- L’inclusivité de la croissance en vue de permettre aux populations maliennes plus particulièrement les plus vulnérables, de participer à l’économie et de bénéficier des fruits d’une croissance forte, inclusive, résiliente et créatrice d’emplois décents ;
- La durabilité environnementale et la résilience à travers des actions de renforcement des capacités des communautés afin de leur permettre de gérer durablement les ressources naturelles et d’être plus résilientes face aux effets néfastes du changement climatique ;

Axe 3 : Services sociaux de base et Protection sociale inclusive avec deux effets centrés Sur :
- L’accès plus équitable aux services sociaux de base de qualité pour les femmes, les enfants, les adolescents et les jeunes ;
- L’amélioration de l’accès aux services de protection sociale et aux actions humanitaires pour les personnes vulnérables[1] y compris celles en situation d’urgence.
 
2. Le BOS du Mali s’inscrit dans le cadre de l’agenda d’efficience prôné par le Secrétaire Général dans la réforme du Système des Nations Unies. Il est axé sur les résultats, et se concentre sur les activités de gestion et les opérations communes visant à éliminer les chevauchements, tirer parti du pouvoir de négociation des Nations Unies et maximiser les économies d’échelles. Il promeut spécifiquement les principes de satisfaction du client, de la qualité des services et de l’optimisation des coûts.

3. Le BOS du Mali est élaboré pour la période 2021-2025 et s’articule autour de 5 catégories de services et 25 lignes en 2021. Il est mis en œuvre suivant un plan de travail et de ressources approuvés annuellement par l’Equipe pays, avec le soutien de l’équipe de gestion opérationnelle (OMT) et l’appui technique de l’équipe de services communs. Il est examiné sur une base annuelle afin de prendre en compte les différentes évolutions de l’environnement et du contexte afin de maximiser les gains et les coûts évités.

4. A l’issue de l’examen 2021 de la première mise e œuvre du BOS, les coûts évités réels pour le Système des Nations Unies au Mali s’élèvent à $455179, ce qui est très encourageant compte tenu du contexte de mise en œuvre marqué notamment par la persistance de la pandémie de la COVID 19 et l’instabilité politique et sécuritaire au Mali. Le service commun relatif à la sécurité et au gardiennage présente les plus forts coûts évités, $270097 en 2021. Les services relatifs aux solutions de durabilités environnementale dont les installations solaires dans les bureaux avec des coût évités 56575 $ présentent quant à eux un très fort impact notamment sur la qualité de l’environnement de travail et la continuité des services.

5. La qualité des services communs est en nette amélioration sur la base de l’enquête de satisfaction menée. En effet des avancées majeures sont notées dans le domaine des infrastructures durables et des services de l’administration, y compris les locaux communs. Des activités novatrices ont été lancées à l’exemple de l’installation progressive de l’Energie solaire. Il est à noter cependant que l’un des défis majeurs reste les données prévisionnelles de qualité. Par conséquent des outils et moyens de mesure de la qualité de services seront approfondis à partir de l’exercice 2022.
 
3. Dès l’année prochaine le BOS Mali recentrera aussi ses efforts sur les services communs qui apportent plus de valeur ajoutée en termes de qualité des services et de coûts évités. A cet effet, l’amplification de l’optimisation de la gestion des locaux communs suivant les standards des Nations Unies en cours de développement, la mise à l’échelle des solutions de durabilité environnementale et des accords-cadres à long termes (LTA) les plus prometteurs seront parmi les priorités.

MMR;Myanmar;366;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The UN Country Team (UNCT) Myanmar launched its first Business Operations Strategy (BOS) in June 2018, making the BOS a priority and building on the progress achieved in the past years implementing a ""Delivering as One"" approach in Myanmar. 

Using the opportunity to transit onto the BOS 2.0 on-line platform, the Operations Management Team (OMT) in Myanmar in 2020 reviewed the progress of all outcome areas (Admin & Logistics, Facilities services, Finance, Human Resources, Information Communications Technology and Procurement) and made adjustments and revisions where necessary. 

Therefore, the BOS start date of 2020 indicated in the BOS 2.0 online portal is the initial review date bringing the originally launched BOS up-to-date covering the years from 2018 - 2024 and making sure that the document remains a living strategy.

In the initial BOS 2.0., the UN in Myanmar was aiming to avoid costs of approx. USD 4.9 million through various collaborative approaches and common services.  Roughly 50% of these costs were expected to be saved in the common administration services including common facilities and premises.  The remaining 50% of cost avoidance was to be obtained through common finance, ICT, procurement, logistics and human resources services.

After the annual review 2023, the cost avoidance envisioned in the revised BOS 2.0 has increased to USD 6.4 million over a period of five years, with almost USD 2.7 million to be saved in common administration services, including common facilities and premises, and $2.5 million to be saved in common logistics.

The OMT put significant efforts into making a tangible progress in the implementation of the BOS Myanmar since the strategy was launched in mid-2018 and reported over USD 5 million cost avoidance achieved for the period 2019-2022 (USD 1.5 million in 2022).

These gains are the more impressive considering the continued impact of the military takeover of February 2021 on UN staff and operations in Myanmar, and by the COVID-19 pandemic impact in 2022. This said, achieving cost avoidance and quality improvements through common services remains an important priority of the OMT despite a continuously difficult operating environment."
MNE;Montenegro;364;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Montenegro is a Delivering as One country (DaO) which in 2009 voluntarily adopted this work approach, led by the Government of Montenegro and the UN System in the country.

2017-2021 BOS was developed as “Light”, meaning that for several services Cost Benefit Analyses has not been undertaken. Considering that the new BOS platform does not support the Light BOS, but also that some parts of the BOS are not relevant anymore, it was decided to develop completely new BOS covering period 2020-2024. 

This Business Operations Strategy 2020- 2024 builds on ongoing efforts by the UN Country Team to harmonize and simplify its business operations, as well as aim to introduce new opportunities for collaboration and initiatives for the UNCT for the period of five years. Considering that UN system in Montenegro works jointly since 2009and that volume of operations is small (12 to 15 million USD annually), it is concluded that most of the benefits from the existing common services have already been achieved. Therefore, the BOS focuses primarily on enhancing the quality of services and increasing on cost avoidance. However, increasing of cost savings on externally sourced goods and services for some common services is also planned to be achieved.

BOS represents a simplified - yet comprehensive, integrated and coherent framework reflecting instruments for quantified cost-benefit analysis, results-based planning, monitoring and evaluation. This cost avoidance is different to savings as it is not reflected in terms of financial gains in budget but rather leads to less recurrent and labour costs.

In its development, the BOS 2.0 reflects 4 common service areas:
Common Administration Services including common Facilities/Premises, Common Human Resource Services, Common ICT Services, Common Procurement Services.

BOS ensures cooperation in 22 common services. At the moment of BOS development in 2020, it was estimated that as a result of its full implementation over the five years, total benefit will be over 476.000$. It is worth mentioning that the majority of the avoidance was a result of common admin and ICT services particularly interpretation/ translation and editing services as well as travel and internet.

The BOS review 2023 showed the total benefit of 335k as a result of more accurate planning.

In 2022 OMT has implemented a number of new services such as: human resource surveys, PSEA and a number of services related to disability inclusion in business operations such as improved physical accessibility of the common premises, ICT accessibility assessment, training of staff on disability issues.

Following assessment of physical and IT accessibility, UNDP has started with implementation of the measures in the UN Eco House. A number of physical improvements have been made, especially in relation to the people with visual impairments, as the assessment showed that UN House was not accessible for visually impaired people at all, while mostly accessible for people with physical disability. The measures included installation of tactile paths inside and outside of the building, orientation plan, inscriptions in Braille, anti-slip paths, railings and handrails, ramps and adaptation of toilettes. A number of capacity building activities have been conducted, including encouraging all the staff to complete the newly issued UN disability inclusion course. The rate of completion of the course at UN level at the ned of 2022 was 60%.

Specific effort of the OMT in 2023 will be invested on advancing of disability inclusion in HR practices for which assessment in taking place in 2023."
MNG;Mongolia;363;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Mongolia’s Business Operations Strategy (BOS) is composed of 12 participating agencies.

For the period of 2019-2022 the BOS in Mongolia was comprised of 3 common services in 2022 (Travel, Printing and Internet)  the realized benefits for a collective effort are 74,336 USD while projected cost avoidance during 2019-2024 was 450,455 USD.

As a result of the latest BOS review the UN in Mongolia is working in further integration and expanding to 7 services in 2023 (Cleaning, Printing, Security, Travel, Internet , Network Infrastructure and Vendor database).  These additional services were selected  considering as the potential opportunity to enhance quality  and cost effectiveness. The projected realized benefits would be 304,5300 USD and cost avoidance for the period is 763,010 USD for the period 2019-2024. "
MOZ;Mozambique;365;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"This year marks the beginning of the new Mozambique United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF 2022-2026) which articulates the strategic engagement of the UNCT in Mozambique to support the country to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the national priorities. The UN RCO and twenty-five (25) UN agencies committed to work together in pursuit of the strategic priorities laid out in the UNSDCF 2022 – 2026 towards achieving the SDGs in Mozambique. Seven Agencies are non-resident and thus not participating in BOS and these are: ECA, ITC, OHCHR, UNCDF, UNCTAD, UNEP, and UNV. The UN resident agencies including UN RCO and participating in BOS are FAO, IFAD, ILO, IOM, OCHA, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHABITAT, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNIDO, UNODC, UNOPS, UN WOMEN, WFP and WHO.

Spearhead by the Resident Coordinator, facilitated and implemented by OMT and sustained by UNCT leadership and engagement, the Mozambique Business Operations Strategy (BOS) 2021–2025 is a results-based framework focusing on joint business operations with the purpose of eliminating duplication, leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN and maximizing economies of scale.

Developed in 2021 as part of the BOS 2.0 exercise, the BOS expects to improve quality of services, including cost savings on externally sourced goods and services. Indeed, it aims at coordinating and aligning its activities for more efficient and effective service delivery, including the COVID-19 response, targeting the expected corporate results in cost and quality parameters, supporting DaO approach to operations and added value from business operations to UN Mandates. It supports maximizing the United Nation System collective advantage in addressing the humanitarian-development-peace nexus and aligning itself to the Sustainable Development Goals.

The 2022 annual review indicated that UNCT Mozambique has achieved cost avoidance of USD 3.8 million (USD 0.44 in 2019 and USD 0.35 in 2020, USD 1.40 million in 2021 and USD 1.61 in 2022). The estimated cost avoidance up to the year 2027 has reached on this year’s review to USD 45.0 million (against the original estimate of USD 7.6 million). The highest projection of estimate is under ICT equipment (USD 36 million). The top 10 services with the highest estimate cost avoidance are the below in order of rank.

1) Mobile phone services including scratch cards.
2) Joint Procurement services
3) Management of common premises
4) Travel services
5) Vehicle rental
6) Internet connectivity and VSAT services
7) Construction related materials and services
8) Harmonized customs clearance (outsourced)
9) Conference and event management
10) Help desk (first line support services).

Overall, during the review, considerable emphasis was put not only on reviewing and assessing the services, but also developing a more detailed implementation plan with more specific timelines. The 2022 Annual Review allowed an addition of 12 new common services, including some of SDG impact (gender and disability inclusion).

The UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator (RC/HC) led the overall BOS review process; the UNCT provided the oversight and approval and provided the necessary staff members to participate in the exercise; the Operations Management Team, co-chaired by UNDP Resident Representative and IOM Chief of Mission, and the OMT Working Groups were responsible to facilitate the collection of the data, the analysis and updating the implementation plan."
MRT;Mauritania;360;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"La réforme du Système de développement des Nations Unies prévoit une refonte du dispositif fonctionnel au niveau des pays dont la première étape encourage une plus grande collaboration entre les agences parties au Plan-cadre de coopération pour le développement durable (PCDD) dans le cadre de la mise en place d’une stratégie de gestion des ressources communes (business operations Strategy ou BOS).

 La BOS est un cadre de résultats et de planification conjoint qui engage les agences signataires du PCDD à renforcer leur collaboration afin d’améliorer la qualité de leurs services de gestion et d’appui opérationnels, et à réaliser des économies de coûts permettant d’optimiser les fonds qui leur sont confiés pour les activités au bénéfice de la réalisation des Objectifs de Développement Durable. La BOS vise à éliminer les doublons, à tirer parti du pouvoir de négociation conjoint, et à faire des économies d’échelle, tout en améliorant la qualité des services fournis.

La BOS 2.0 s’appuie sur une méthodologie renforcée et sur une plateforme en ligne. Afin de favoriser l’exécution efficace des plans-cadres de coopération et des composantes du Programme 2030 de développement durable, le Secrétaire général a demandé à toutes les équipes de pays de mettre en place la stratégie améliorée BOS 2.0 d’ici à 2022.

Les agences, fonds et programmes suivants participent à la BOS 2.0 de la Mauritanie : BIT, FAO, OHCHR, OIM, OMS, ONUSIDA, PAM, PNUD, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNHCR, UNODC, UNOWAS, UNS-RCO. 

 Le Coordonnateur Résident est redevable au Secrétaire général de l’élaboration, de la mise en œuvre, du suivi et du rapport annuel sur la BOS. L’Équipe de pays a fourni les orientations stratégiques, assuré la supervision générale de l’élaboration de la stratégie et sa validation, et mis à la disposition de l’OMT les ressources humaines et financières nécessaires. L’OMT et ses groupes de travail ont élaboré la stratégie et son plan de mise en œuvre.  La BOS 2.0 de la Mauritanie a été élaborée de manière participative, en étroite consultation avec toutes les agences participantes. Elle reflète les priorités identifiées lors de ces discussions, étayées par des analyses détaillées, et définit les résultats stratégiques à court et moyen termes qui guideront la collaboration entre les agences au cours des deux prochaines années restantes avant la fin du Cycle de Programmation qui arrive à terme en fin 2023 

 À la demande de l’Équipe de pays, l’OMT a priorisé les lignes de services « Administration », « Achats », « Finances », « Ressources Humaines », et « Technologies de l'Information et de la Communication ».  Seize services communs ont été retenus, dont la mise en œuvre devait permettre des économies de coûts d’environ 2.40 millions USD. L'équipe de pays des Nations Unies a réalisé un évitement des couts de 1.38 million sur une projection de 2.40 millions lors de l'examen BOS 2.0 sur la période 2019-2022

La revue de l'exécution de la BOS de la Mauritanie a démontré que des bénéfices qualitatifs ont été obtenus avec la mise en place d’une base de données centrale pour les LTA, laquelle facilite, la collaboration en matière d’achats et contribuera, à terme, à fournir des services d’approvisionnement sensibles au genre et aux populations à besoins spécifiques, tout en prenant en compte la promotion d'une consommation écologique axée sur la réduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre. En outre, grâce à la mutualisation d’une série de services visant la mise en place d’un barème harmonisé, la formation du staff sur le PSEA, et d’une stratégie genre dans le recrutement du personnel, il est attendu d'ici fin 2023 une amélioration sensible de la qualité de l’environnement du travail et de l’épanouissement du personnel UN.

Les gains escomptés de la BOS 2.0 s’appuient sur plusieurs hypothèses, dont la disponibilité des ressources humaines et financières nécessaires à sa mise en œuvre, et l’engagement des agences de s’appuyer prioritairement sur les accords à long terme (LTAs) communs pour l’acquisition de biens et services.  Plusieurs risques ont été identifiés, parmi lesquels l’engagement individuel des agences reste un des plus importants, ainsi que la capacité du marché local à répondre aux besoins."
MUS;Mauritius;361;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"With a desire to streamline the implementation the two  United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks (UNSDCF) 2019 – 2021, for MCO Mauritius and Seychelles, the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Mauritius and Seychelles developed Business Operations Strategy (BOS) 1.0 (2020 – 2023) to coordinate and align its activities for more efficient and effective service delivery including COVID 19 response, thereby mitigating duplication of processes, curtail transaction costs and enhance operational efficiency...

The Business Operations Strategy (BOS) developed in 2020 was the first of its kind and focused on joint business operations with the purpose of eliminating duplication, leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN, and maximizing economies of scale. This first BOS developed in 2020 identified seven common services for future collaboration namely; Common Administration services, Common cleaning services, Common UN premises, Common procurement services, common parking services, common security services, and common Gender responsive services, common procurement sourcing. RCO Mauritius is an MCO covering Mauritius and Seychelles, noteworthy in 2021 the RCO established a fully functional liaison office in Seychelles. Some Non-Resident Agencies (NRAs) will benefit from the newly established RCO liaison office and some components like procurement, human resources and IT services when they travel to the MCO through agency focal persons who are in Mauritius or Seychelles. 

Since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in 2020, the UNCT in Mauritius and Seychelles has given strong priority to UN care and staff welfare activities which include vaccination and COVID19 testing. The UN care and staff wellbeing activities were integrated into the BOS during the 2022 annual review.

Overall, during the 2022 BOS review, the focus was put on not only reviewing and assessing the services but also strengthening the BOS contribution to support the achievement of high impact programmatic results, especially in the area “Leaving No One Behind”, Gender equality, and PSEA. In this regards the following new activities were added to the BOS; Human Resources surveys, PSEA - Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, UN activities (UN Cares & UN Day), Environmental Responsive Procurement Sourcing. Participating agencies are UNRCO, UNDP, IOM and WHO. Non Resident Agencies that contribute to the Cooperation Framework include UNFPA, UNODC and FAO, noting that UNICEF does not implement any activities in Mauritius currently.

Following the 2020 annual review, the overall cost avoidance for the next five years is estimated at 349 thousand US dollars from February 2022 to December 2026 which is an important saving considering that Mauritius is operating in Typology 2 (Total UNCT investment between 40,000 and 100,000 USD).  The initial cost avoidance was 166 thousand US dollars and it is 183 thousand during the 2022 annual review.

Implementation of the BOS will not only lead to cost avoidance but also to quality improvement of services which will be monitored throughout the life on the BOS."
MWI;Malawi;419;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The UN's Business Operations Strategy (BOS 2.0) is a results-based framework that aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) and aims to improve the efficiency of UN business operations through joint efforts. The 2022 annual review report, which covers the period from 2019 to 2022, indicates that the Malawi BOS 2.0 was successful in delivering a total cost avoidance of $3,034,586. Out of this total, $1,110,287 was realized specifically in the year 2022.

The Operations Management Team and its Technical Working Groups, under the leadership of the UNCT, focused on mitigating duplication of business processes within the UN system, leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN due to increased volumes from collaboration, and maximizing economies of scale.

As a result of the BOS implementation, the UN in Malawi achieved large cost avoidances in several areas, including vendor assessments and contract management services ($688,390), travel services ($563,597), storage and warehouse management services ($318,079), vehicle rental ($271,704), and fuel management ($242,656).

In 2022, UN Malawi also implemented High Impact Common Services that were selected for their potential to improve service quality, promote good practices, and advance the SDG agenda. For example, a UN Primary Care Clinic was established, which is currently providing improved quality access to primary health care to UN personnel and their dependents. This has allowed for staff medical needs to be addressed with ease and efficiency. Additionally, initiatives for the Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) in individual agencies have been harmonized as a common service, facilitated by a coordinator in the Resident Coordinator's Office, to support UNCT in its six-priority programmatic areas.

To address power outages in Malawi, the OMT's Administration Working Group is exploring the potential of establishing a common service for green energy solar home kits as a cost-effective and sustainable green solution for staff power backup.

To lead by example in gender-responsive procurement, OMT's Procurement Working Group will harmonize the current efforts in agencies and scale up the sustainable selection of services and goods that take into account the impact of gender equality and women's empowerment.

During the BOS review, it was also decided to discontinue some common services for lack of expected quality improvement or potential cost avoidance in the foreseeable future, including knowledge sharing, rate harmonization and media monitoring. While HR support to COVID-19 response was discontinued since the COVID treatment centre was shut down in March 2022.

BOS data and reporting for the following entities FAO, IFAD, UNAIDS, UNS, UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO were validated by their entity HQ/RO focal point before being presented to UNCT. On completion of the quality assurance processes, the results of the annual review and 2023 budget were submitted to UNCT for endorsement on 13 April 2023.

Following a consultative process, UNCT endorsed the 2023 BOS on 14 April 2023, committing to the allocation of financial (BOS Budget - $ 814,205) and human resources (staff time) for the achievement of BOS objectives, with mutual recognition as a veritable driver for collaboration."
MYS;Malaysia;357;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The United Nations presence in Malaysia is currently composed of 18 organisations (12 residents agencies, 4 Global Service Centres and 2 non-resident agencies). The United Nations Sustainable Development Framework (UNSCDF) 2021-2025 was completed in 2020. While it is still in the process of official endorsement, the UNSDCF has de facto framed and guided the work of the UN in Malaysia.  It forms the basis of the Country Programme Documents of UNDP, UNICEF and UNFPA, which were approved by their respective Executive Boards in 2022.

As per lesson learnt in 2021, Malaysia strengthen its BoS accountability and workforce by designating a BoS coordinator (Maria Aurea Guevara, IOM) and implementing 4 working groups (Admin, Procurement, Finance, and ICT). In November 2022, a BoS info session was conducted with OMT and Working group members (38 staff from 11 different UN entities). In December 2022, the BoS coordinator engaged individually with the Working Groups to prepare and conduct the BoS retreat in January 2023.

During the BoS retreat, the Malaysia team reviewed BoS and decided to:

i) Discontinue 6 dormant services (Accommodation, Graph Design, Furniture, Catering, Customs Clearance and Fuel management)

ii) Scale up 2 stocktake services (Conference and event management, Interpretation and translation services)

iii) Implement 3 new services (Central Database for Vendors, Micro Assessment, Printing Services)

As part of the annual review, Malaysia team took the opportunity to correct previous years’ data to reflect a more accurate forecast and corrected the common premises data by excluding the rental cost.  Rental cost was excluded because the cost saving is already captured in the common premises survey. 

The total realized benefit in 2022 was around US$ 254,000 (mostly in Management of Common premises and Travel services). Overall, since 2021, there is a realized benefit of US$ 500,000 and estimated benefit of US$ 1,600,000 by the end of 2025. The top 3 impact services are the Management of Common premises, Travel and transport services and the top 3 quality services are (Central Database for LTAs, Vendors Performance and Common Knowledge platform).

The annual review in 2022 shown that Malaysia team has reached a maturity level were the BoS process is well characterized and understood, demonstrating proactive participation from OMT and WG members. Unfortunately, the global BoS platform still is not mature and has various software glitches and limitations causing frustration, demotivation and confusion. This was mitigated with the Regional and Global support. Still, it requires urgent attention from the global team to enhance the software further and avoid fixing it during Annual Review exercises."
NAM;Namibia;409;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The Namibia BOS represents the joint efforts of the OMT, supported by the UNCT, to establish a strategic framework for common business operations for the period 2019-2024. The overall aim is to achieve greater impact by being coherent and effective in delivering development results and humanitarian support while harmonizing business practices across agencies for increased efficiency.

The BOS is primarily focused on efficiency gains and cost avoidance while simultaneously improving the quality of services, including cost savings on externally sourced goods and services, and eliminating duplication of efforts. The strategy is to focus on common services that are implemented jointly or delivered by one UN entity on behalf of one or more other UN entities. Identified areas for collaboration include Administration, Human Resources, Information, Communications and Technology, Finance, and Procurement.

The UNCT is composed of 11 members, and there are 14 UN Agencies, Funds, and Programmes located in the UN House Common Premises contributing to the BOS. In the context of the UNDS reform, UNIC and UNDSS’s data were combined into one with that of the RCO. UNDSS is exclusively staffed with a National Field Security Assistant.

Prepared through a highly consultative process with inputs from various UN Organizations in Namibia, the BOS aims to support effective program delivery, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting on common operations. The Operations Management Team (OMT) and its technical Working Groups within the various UN Organizations launched consultations throughout the BOS 2.0 development process to optimize the performance of their key functional areas of operations. The BOS underscores key priority areas arising from these discussions, which are strengthened by a detailed operational analysis. Short and medium-term strategic results were identified that will guide the monitoring and evaluation of operations in the above-mentioned six (6) common services during the BOS program cycle (2019-2024).

The management arrangements for the Namibia BOS support the overall governance and accountability of BOS. A working group (WG) structure has been updated to correspond with the pillars of BOS. This strengthened operational structure supports the overall implementation of the BOS activities by the OMT and will be the foundation for rolling out effective monitoring of BOS on an annual basis and evaluation in the penultimate year of the BOS. The management arrangements highlight the strong linkage between BOS and the UNPAF 2019-2024, which is a strong basis for the continued identification of common services that will support efficient and effective programming of the UN Namibia. Management arrangements show a clear connection between BOS WGs, the OMT, and UNCT, which reflects the potential for effective communication between all levels of management and the implementation of BOS activities. The UNCT is recognized for its leadership role and the delegated responsibility passed on to the OMT for the day-to-day management of the BOS. Resources required to implement the BOS activities are reflected in the Common Budgetary Framework. Agencies are expected to mobilize resources to fully fund all common services with budget gaps.

The Namibia BOS 2019-2024 adopts a results-based management (RBM) approach and presents a Results Framework that provides the indicators, baselines, and targets to allow for the ongoing monitoring of BOS results with regard to both cost and quality. Established baselines provide the data sources for this monitoring and draw on the data gathered through OMT’s operational analysis process.

After the annual review of the achieved benefits and the BOS review process, the expected cost avoidance to be achieved during the first 5-year of the period has been revised from USD 425,732.00 to USD 982,403.00, out of which cost avoidance of USD 141,079.00 was achieved between 2019-2022, from Common Compound Security services(69,376.00), Cleaning Services(44,457.00) and Common ICT Services(27,246.00), respectively.

The Namibia BOS also emphasizes the importance of disability inclusion, with one of the key performance indicators (KPIs) under the Human Resources common service being staff training and activities for disability inclusion. In addition to the Namibia BOS's emphasis on disability inclusion, the Office of the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Namibia has taken significant steps towards promoting inclusivity and gender equality through its One UN Management (OMT) approach. OMT has added three key performance indicators (KPIs) under the common procurement services which include Mapping of Accessible (Disability & Inclusion) venues, Accessibility (Disability and Inclusion) in Procurement Services, and Gender Responsive Procurement Sourcing. These KPIs demonstrate OMT's commitment to ensuring that procurement services are inclusive of all individuals, including those with disabilities and diverse genders. The OMT's focus on accessibility and gender equality aligns with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 5: Gender Equality and Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities.

In addition to the newly added common services mentioned above, OMT has also recognized the importance of digital and web accessibility for persons with disabilities. As a result, one of the KPIs under the ICT common service is the Mapping of Digital and Web Accessibility. This KPI highlights OMT's commitment to ensuring that its digital and web services are inclusive of persons with disabilities. OMT understands that technology plays a critical role in modern-day communication and has the potential to be a game-changer for persons with disabilities. Therefore, the organization is taking proactive measures to ensure digital inclusivity.

Furthermore, in response to the DCO's recommendation for highly recommended common services, OMT has introduced the BOS Conferencing and Accommodation common services. This new KPI is focused on Conferencing and Event Management, which includes the rental of conference facilities and outsourcing of event management services. This addition reflects OMT's commitment to providing comprehensive and high-quality services to its member agencies.

During the 2023 BOS review, a more detailed implementation plan was developed with specific timelines, and lead agencies and responsible persons for activities under each service were reviewed and updated. The training was provided to some OMT colleagues to facilitate the BOS annual review process, and OMT and BOS working group members are encouraged to complete the online BOS training course.

Overall, the Namibia BOS aims to achieve greater impact by being coherent and effective in delivering development results and humanitarian support while harmonizing business practices across agencies for increased efficiency. With the commitment of UNCT members to allocate financial and human resources for the achievement of BOS objectives, the BOS will continue to support effective program delivery, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting on common operations in Namibia."

L’UNSDCF a été aligné sur les priorités programmatiques du Plan de développement économique et social (PDES) 2022-2026 en cours d’exécution à la suite de la Table Rode des partenaires et donateurs tenue à Paris, du 5 au 6 décembre 2022. La Stratégie des opérations commerciales (BOS) 2.0 (2020-2025) initiée par l'Equipe Pays des Nations Unies (UNCT) au Niger vise principalement, à aligner ses activités en vue de fournir à ses partenaires et clients des services de qualité dans les délais requis pour en garantir l’efficiente et efficace, tout en tenant dûment compte du caractère parfois volatile de la question sécuritaire et de l’imprévisibilité de l’impact du changement climatique. L’exigence d’éviter autant que possible toute duplication des processus est recommandée par cette stratégie qui recherche l’optimisation des coûts transactionnels des interventions menées par le Système des Nations unies (SNU) contribuant ainsi à l’amélioration de l'efficacité opérationnelle. Le BOS 2.0 qui sous-tend la mise en œuvre du UNSDCF, vise à soutenir la maximisation de l'avantage collectif des Nations Unies (ONU). Pour ce faire, le Nexus humanitaire-développement-paix et sécurité est abordé par l’Equipe Pays en s'alignant sur les cinq axes prioritaires du PNDES, à savoir : la renaissance culturelle ; ii) le développement social et la transition démographique ; iii) l'accélération de la croissance économique ; iv) l'amélioration de la gouvernance, de la paix et de la sécurité ; et, v) la gestion durable de l'environnement. Il convient de souligner que l'UNSDCF 2023-2027 comporte trois (3) domaines d'interventions prioritaires que sont : la Résilience, Gouvernance-Paix-Sécurité, le Développement Social et le Dividende Démographique. Ils ont été déclinés en cinq (5) résultats dont la réalisation suppose la mobilisation et l'affectation de ressources financières au profit de l’ensemble des populations y compris les communautés les plus vulnérables des régions prioritaires.

Il convient d'indiquer que le nouveau Plan de développement économique et social (PDES) 2022-2026 en cours d’exécution s'articule autour des trois (3) axes stratégiques suivants: i) Développement du capital humain, inclusion et solidarité ; ii) Consolidation de la gouvernance, paix et sécurité ; et, iii) Transformation structurelle de l’économie. Ce Plan a été décliné en quatorze (14) programmes thématiques qui couvrent les principaux secteurs d’interventions devant soutenir l’atteinte de la vision de développement du pays. Celle-ci a été définie dans la Stratégie de Développement Durable et de Croissance Inclusive (SDDCI) Niger 2035, comme suit : « un pays uni, démocratique et moderne, paisible, prospère et fier de ses valeurs culturelles, sous-tendu par un développement durable, éthique, équitable et équilibré, dans une Afrique unie et solidaire ».

La stratégie des opérations commerciales (BOS) est un cadre axé sur les résultats qui se concentre sur les opérations commerciales conjointes dans le but d'éliminer les doubles emplois, de tirer parti de la capacité de négociation commune des agences du Système des Nations unies afin de maximiser le potentiel des économies d'échelle réalisables sur la période considérée. Le BOS 2.0 (2020-2025) a été développé via la plateforme en ligne BOS le 1er avril 2020. Il passe par une phase de suivi annuel et fera l’objet d’une revue en septembre 2023. Le BOS se focalise sur les services communs mis en œuvre conjointement ou livrés par une entité des Nations Unies pour le compte d'une ou plusieurs autres entités des Nations Unies. Des services communs pour une collaboration future ont été identifiés dans les domaines des services administratifs communs, des services financiers communs, des services communs des ressources humaines, des services communs des technologies de l'information et des communications (TIC), de la logistique commune et des services d'achat. Les organisations des Nations Unies suivantes participent au BOS 2.0 (2020-2025) au Niger: FAO, OIM, OMS, PAM, PNUD, UNAIDS, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UN OCHA, UN HCDH, UNOPS, le Bureau de la Coordonnatrice résidente des Nations Unies et autres entités du Secrétariat (UN CEA, UN RCO), UNV, ONU Femmes. Mme Louise Irène AUBIN, Coordonnatrice résidente et humanitaire des Nations Unies (RC / HC), est responsable devant le Secrétaire général du développement, de la mise en œuvre, du suivi et de l'établissement de rapports du BOS 2.0 et des étapes vers un Back Office commun (CBO). L'Equipe pays des Nations Unies supervise globalement le processus BOS 2.0, approuve et libère les organisations des Nations Unies nécessaires et les ressources conjointes, approuve le BOS 2.0 final et rend compte annuellement. L'équipe de gestion des opérations et ses organes subsidiaires sont chargés de faciliter l'élaboration et la mise en œuvre du BOS au niveau national. Le Bureau de coordination du développement (DCO) est responsable de la coordination, de l'orientation et du soutien à l'Equipe pays des Nations Unies et au CR / HC des Nations Unies sur le BOS 2.0.

S'appuyant sur les leçons apprises au regard de la façon d'améliorer les mécanismes de gestion du principe « d’Opérer-Unis » (‘Operating as One’ (OaO) ), le BOS 2.0 (2020-2025) a été revigoré et a maintenu essentiellement pour le Niger, les cinq (5) résultats suivants : achats communs, administration commune, logistique commune, ressources humaines communes et, Technologies communes de l'information et des communications (TIC). La nouvelle itération du BOS est également soutenue par une plate-forme en ligne qui guide l'équipe de gestion des opérations (OMT) pour réduire davantage la complexité et les coûts de transaction pour le développement du BOS et ouvrir de nouvelles opportunités pour l'OMT, l'Equipe Pays des Nations Unies, la Direction régionale et le Siège pour surveiller, analyser et rendre compte de l’impact du BOS, tant du point de vue de la réduction des coûts que de l’amélioration de la qualité des services rendus.

Le BOS 2.0 (2020-2025) a été préparé dans le cadre d'un processus consultatif en diverses étapes avec la contribution des organisations des Nations Unies présentes au Niger, dans le but ultime de soutenir la mise en œuvre efficace des programmes, d’assurer le suivi-évaluation et l'établissement de rapports sur les opérations communes. Des consultations avec l'OMT, ses groupes de travail techniques et le Groupe du programme, de la planification et de la performance (PPPG) au sein des différentes organisations des Nations Unies ont été entreprises comme recommandé, pour calibrer le niveau de performance en ce qui concerne leurs principales fonctions opérationnelles. Le BOS 2.0 souligne par conséquent, les domaines prioritaires clés découlant de ces discussions renforcées par une analyse opérationnelle détaillée et fournit les résultats stratégiques à court et moyen terme qui vont guider le suivi et l'évaluation des opérations dans les cinq (5) services communs susmentionnés au cours de la mise en œuvre de l'UNSDCF 2022-2023 en cours. Le BOS 2.0 (2020-2025) est un document dynamique. Sa mise en œuvre et son opérationnalisation s’effectuent par l’entremise des cinq (5) groupes de travail stratégiques de l'OMT que sont : i) Administration commune, ii) Achats et Logistique communs, iii) Finances et HACT, iv) TIC communes, v) Ressources humaines communes. L'OMT fourni l’assistance techniques, les orientations et conseils requis pour soutenir la planification conjointe, le suivi de l’exécution des interventions et facilite la coordination de la communication des résultats. Les activités inter-agences mises en œuvre dans les domaines sus indiqués contribuent à l’amélioration escomptée ne terme notamment de rapport coûts-bénéfices, qualité et efficacité de l’appui de l’Equipe pays des Nations Unies à l’exécution des programmes et aux opérations. La mise en œuvre du BOS 2.0 devrait permettre d'éviter des coûts nets de USD 4,129,312 grâce à l'harmonisation des opérations commerciales sur la période 2020-2025, soit cinq (5) ans. L'analyse coûts-bénéfices montre spécifiquement que les économies monétaires seront les plus élevées dans le Service Administratif commun avec une réduction potentielle des coûts de l’ordre de USD 1,049,899, soit 25% des bénéfices totaux générés par le BOS 2.0. On s'attend à ce que les services TIC communs apportent des améliorations qualitatives plutôt qu'une réduction substantielle des coûts. En 2022, l'UNCT a pu réaliser un cost avoidance de USD 1,565,855 au titre du BOS.

En outre, l'équipe de pays des Nations Unies au Niger a révisé sur la base des engagements convenus dans le UNSDCF, la considération des interventions à réaliser pour l'atteinte des ODD. La problématique du Genre, la question récurrente de la sécurité, du changement climatique et du renforcement de la résilience des communautés. La prise en compte de la digitalisation pour promouvoir des innovations dans les chaînes de valeurs productives a également été considérée tout comme l'utilisation appropriée des technologies digitale de l'information et de la communications (TIC) bien contextualisées."
NGA;Nigeria;369;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The United Nations Sustainable Development Partnership Framework (UNSDPF) 2018 - 2022, signed on 27 July 2017, between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the United Nations System, is a strategic common programmatic framework intended to serve as a collective offer to catalytic initiatives to drive the national development priorities of Nigeria. Twenty-one UN agencies committed to work together in pursuit of the strategic priorities laid out in the UNSDCF 2018-2022 towards achieving the National Development Strategy and the SDGs in Nigeria. As a critical strategy in achieving the effective implementation of the UNSDPF and in line with the UN efficiency reforms, the UNCT developed a Business Operations Strategy (BOS) to enhance cost savings and harness operational effectiveness for participating agencies for the purpose of accelerating progress towards the attainment of SDGs as savings from the BOS will serve as additional funds for programmes.  The agencies participating in BOS are FAO, IFAD, ILO, IOM, UN, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNIDO, UNOPS, UNDSS, UNOCHA, UN HABITAT, UNODC, UN WOMEN, WFP, WHO, WMO.

The Operations Management Team (OMT), made up of key operations technical staff from resident agencies and with support from UN Common Services and the RCO, lead the implementation of the efficiency agenda for effective delivery of the UNSDPF through the implementation of the signed Business Operation Strategy (BOS), implementation of the Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfers (HACT) and lead the planned move from Common Premises to UN House in Abuja. The OMT, under the guidance of the UNCT, deepened the excellent UN House experience, focusing on measurable efficiency that translated to actual cost-savings for the UN system, partners, and government. The OMT has in its priority to leverage the common premises experience in selected states where the model is programmatically desirable and financially feasible during the UNSDPF cycle.

The UNCT has formulated the BoS (2018-2022) alongside the UNSDPF and has identified five common areas for business operations harmonization in: Procurement, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), Human Resources, Finance &Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfer (HACT) and Administration (which includes travel/Daily Subsistence Allowance harmonization and Common Premises). These areas can collectively reduce material, time, and labour costs during the UNSDPF implementation cycle. By identifying potential “efficiency spaces” across UN common operations, the BoS will provide the missing link between Operations and Programme aspects to functionally and systematically deliver the key outcomes in the UNSDPF through innovative and efficient common processes. The Business Operation Strategy (BOS), being core part of the UNSDPF, has received technical attention and support from the RCO to the OMT to ensure that it is rolled and UNSDPF Implemented.

Having implemented the Business Operations Strategy (BOS) for in the five year period in Nigeria, agencies, funds and programmes, have seen some successes in collaborative activities with service quality improvements, and efficiencies. The 2022review has highlighted specific financial savings and quality harnessed in the implementation of the BOS.

The reviewed BOS projected a cost avoidance estimated at USD 7,170,426 for the period 2019 – 2023 while the realized cost benefit is USD 3,397,243 for the period 2019-2022. The realized cost benefit represents 47.4% of the estimated cost avoidance.

This projection comes amidst socio-political and economic conditions being experienced in the country including high inflation, currency devaluation and general economic recovery in the post COVID-19 period. With foresight, the Procurement Network and agencies’ supply chain management colleagues expanded the vendor base and established Long Term Agreements (LTAs) across various frequently used services that locked in prices with suppliers. These actions have mitigated in some measure against fluctuating prices.

This review revealed that Nigeria is implementing fourteen (14) out of the fifty-two (52) High Impact Common services (HICs). These HICs include (i) Management of common services, (ii) staff counselling services, (iii) UN activities (UN cares & UN Day), (iv) Banking service and bank charges, (v) HACT Audit, (vi) HACT management, (vii) Micro-assessment Database, (viii) Gender Responsive Procurement Sourcing, (ix) Mobile phone services including scratch cards, (x) printing services, (xi) Management of common premises, (xii) security services (outsourced), (xiii) Travel services, and (xiv) carpooling It is hoped that more agencies would adopt these HICs and additional suitable HICs would be adopted for implementation in Nigeria.

The review highlighted the need to adopt accessibility measures of UN common premises to facilitate the implementation of the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy and use of solar energy to augment the electricity supply in the UN House in Abuja. These services were under development at various stages at the time of this review but were not sufficiently defined to be included in the BOS at this time. 

The UNCT thanks the various network groups and the OMT for their diligence in conducting this review and looks forward to achieving programmatic and operational objectives through this cooperation of agencies.

NIC;Nicaragua;425;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Nicaragua no cuenta con un Sistema de Coordinación de Residentes de la ONU (RC/RCO), ni UNSDCF, por lo tanto la Reforma de la ONU no se ha implementado formalmente. En ese contexto, se ha venido trabajando bajo la estructura de una coordinación técnica interagencial, como mecanismo rotatorio que asumen las y los Representantes de las Agencias: FAO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNOPS, WFP desde octubre del año 2015. El Coordinador Técnico Interagencial ( CTI) lidera la reunión de Representantes de agencias de la ONU (UNCT) por mandato y acuerdo de los Representantes de las AFP en el país. El equipo de las Naciones Unidas en el país elabora un plan de trabajo anual y una planeación de fondos de la DCO desde enero de 2020.

Los Representantes han liderado el trabajo del Equipo de País de Naciones Unidas (UNCT), logrando la continuidad de la agenda de desarrollo establecida en cada uno de los programas de cooperación de las agencias con Nicaragua, aprovechando la oportunidad para fortalecer la presencia de las Naciones Unidas y asumiendo el compromiso de reforzar la cohesión de los equipos.

En octubre de 2019, UNDCO hizo el lanzamiento del Business Operations Strategy (BOS) y solicitó a los RCs la conducción de este mandato. Nicaragua está registrada por la Sede (UNDCO) como uno de los 131 países que deben elaborar el BOS al 31 de diciembre de 2020. La Oficina CTI recibió información de este proceso en julio de 2020, pero no se le solicitó formalmente junto con los demás países mediante la comunicación enviada a los RCs. No obstante, en una reunión del 2 de octubre de 2020 el equipo UNCT logró que Nicaragua realizaría el BOS en el 2021 solicitando un trato especial con la fecha límite al 30 de noviembre de 2021. Durante todo este año, por el compromiso del UNCT y del Grupo Interagencial de Operaciones (OMT) y con la asesoría y capacitación de DCO LAC, las AFP en Nicaragua lograron culminar el BOS en la fecha acordada.  

Como parte de las iniciativas de trabajo del SNU, desde el 2018 el OMT está funcionando – antes llamado GIO - con un plan de trabajo anual en temas comunes de operaciones, logrando sistematización en escritorio, simplificación de procesos, eficiencia, ahorros y armonización de procedimientos en aspectos operativos. Este trabajo logrado será de mucho beneficio para iniciar el plan del BOS y avanzar en su implementación. 

De enero a marzo de 2023 se llevó a cabo la revisión anual del BOS.  Este ejercicio permitió valorar y reflexionar sobre el trabajo colaborativo, así como identificar acciones de mejora para fortalecer el trabajo conjunto en los seis componentes del BOS y por ende en los grupos técnicos. Se validaron 30 servicios comunes, con la participación de 8 Agencias (UNFPA, UNOPS, UNICEF, PAHO, FAO, ONUDI, IOM, WFP) y 2 Oficinas (UNS DSS y UNS DCO).  Se reporta un beneficio conjunto de U$507,110 para el 2022.

Los principales beneficios económicos se logran observar en las líneas de servicio de administración, finanzas y logística. El grupo de adquisiciones logró potenciar la gestión del conocimiento e intercambio de experiencias, donde se lograron consolidar productos de gran valor para AFP ìs tales como: bases de datos de LTA´s, generación de más LTA’s, listas de proveedores calificados, identificación de compras conjuntas, acciones de inclusión en las adquisiciones, entre otros elementos que reducirán los tiempos y costos en los servicios previstos para el 2023. Aunque en RRHH no se estima CBA en todos los servicios y por tanto no se puede comparar con el resto de los componentes del  BOS, la revisión anual generó más sinergia entre las Agencias y se acordó un servicio nuevo “Staff training” que el equipo va a desarrollar según las demandas del personal y se dará énfasis al trabajo colaborativo que impacte en el bienestar del personal. El grupo de ICT mantuvo los servicios valorando que el beneficio obtenido es importante y se abrió una oportunidad en cuanto al servicio de telecomunicaciones para ser liderado por UNS DSS en el marco de la estructura de trabajo del SMT.

En términos de la estructura de trabajo para el desarrollo de este ejercicio, el compromiso del Equipo de País ha sido el eje central y el liderazgo del OMT Chair y del OMT CoChair fue clave para lograr los resultados obtenidos, así como también la conducción efectiva de los coordinadores de los seis equipos fue una experiencia exitosa.

Todo el proceso ha generado mayor cohesión de equipo, trabajo conjunto, compromiso, gestión del conocimiento, alianzas entre agencias, y el mayor esfuerzo se enmarca en proyectar la obtención de servicios de mayor calidad. A nivel general, las agencias resaltan como un gran beneficio el networking, el compartir experiencias (entre homólogos), buenas prácticas y lecciones aprendidas en el ámbito de las operaciones."
NPL;Nepal;367;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"In line with the UN Secretary-General (SG) proposal (2017) to reposition the United Nations Development System, an improved Business Operations Strategies (BOS) is mandated for all UNCTs that needs to be formulated by 2021. The BOS is a results-based framework that focuses on joint business operations with the purpose of eliminating duplication, leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN and maximizing economies of scale. It is facilitated by the principle of mutual recognition, and it constitutes a reliable evidence-based foundation for the establishment of common back offices.  

In Nepal, the BOS is focused and structured around six common service lines: finance, human resource management, procurement, logistics, information and communications technology and administration including common facilities/premises management. In addition to individual agency operations and plans, it focuses on common services that are relevant to more than one UN entity.

The impact of UN programmes at the country level is directly related to the effectiveness, efficiency and cost of the operations that support them, and therefore, this document focuses mainly on cost avoidance and quality improvement of business services.

Under the overall guidance and oversight of the UNCT and OMT BOS Task Team, five working groups represented from 18 UN agencies (including UNICEF ROSA), carried out series of discussions and analytical exercises to complete various steps that led to develop this strategy in line with the corporate guidelines. This aligns with the timeline of the UNDAF or UNSDCF (2018-22) Nepal. The UNSDCF 2023-2028 has been recently signed and the activities included in the BOS will be realigned if needed in future.

Nepal suffered heavily due to COVID crisis during 2020 and 2021 and partly 2022 along with Dengue outbreak in most parts of the country. The UN Offices in Nepal opted for teleworking mostly throughout these years. During this time, because of the second and third waves of the pandemic, most parts of the country were placed under strict prohibitory orders with restrictions in mobility imposed by the local administrations. However the country resumed its normal operations from mid 2022, with few agencies partially teleworking until towards the end of 2022.

As support to COVID 19 and staff wellbeing, UN Nepal Operations staff continued to engage in arranging quality care for UN personnel and dependents from liaising with local private hospitals to UN HQ for medical support and providing support through      Duty of Care focal persons under each agency and organising      town halls on COVID 19 and Dengue for all UN personnel. The booster vaccine programme continued in 2022 and is still      ongoing through the UN IOM Clinic and the vaccine focal points continued their involvement for this extended vaccine programme..

UNCT in Nepal was selected for a pilot on Disability Inclusion and resources of US$ 50,000 is allocated in three operation areas, HR, ICT and Administration. In 2022, the implementation of the Disability Inclusion Pilot (DI Pilot) in UN Nepal has significantly strengthened awareness and capacity on disability inclusion within the UN Nepal family, particularly in operations through the work done under the three components of ICT/Digital Accessibility, Human Resources and Physical Accessibility of Common Premises. Staff members were drawn from different agencies’ working groups for the implementation of the pilot project.

Inclusive Human Resources
UNR HR, the focus was on sensitizing UN Personnel through trainings. A total of 203 (106 female, 97 male) were trained on disability inclusion including guards, cleaners, HR focal points, administration, and procurement staff, as well as some hiring managers. A session on disability inclusive hiring and operations related processes      was also integrated into the annual OMT retreat. In addition to these trainings, an online session was held in collaboration with the DCO Accessibility Consultant for the HR Task Force on accessible and inclusive career fairs, as well as a very well attended session on creating accessible online meetings/events for all staff.

The results of the training can be observed, for example in guests with disabilities entering the UN house being provided necessary guidance and assistance in a way that respects disability inclusion etiquette.  This demonstrated that awareness sessions such as these can play a part in addressing some of the stigma around disability and create a more inclusive and caring workplace.

The implementation of the pilot in collaboration with the HR Task Force chair and members, has also triggered a conversation of the equal participation of persons with disabilities in the UN Workforce. The UNV modality has provided the opportunity for targeted job openings for persons with disabilities during 2022.

Physical Accessibility
UN Nepal has made improvements to the physical accessibility of UN Common Premises since the first audit of 2019. The current funding under the DI pilot has allowed for making further significant improvements in line with the 2019 and subsequent accessibility audits of the premises. As part of this pilot, an accessible all gender restroom was constructed; ramps and railings added to several locations at UN house; three new accessible parking spaces introduced in UN House; emergency wheelchairs procured; braille signage and thematic master maps being prepared.

ICT and Digital Accessibility
The Inter-agency IT Task force (IAITTF) under the OMT through a service provider has taken forward several pieces of work in relation to ICT and digital accessibility. These activities have included: a mapping of market vendors for accessible equipment, services, and tools; development of a checklist of minimum standards to ensure inclusive and accessible ICT services (drafting stage); checklist on accessibility documents (ppt, word, excel) to be utilised      by UN Personnel including a set of minimum standards for documents to be uploaded on the UN Nepal website (drafting); and mapping and accessibility audits select of software and hardware used by the UNCT. Furthermore, digital accessibility assessments have been carried out of websites and webapps of various UN Agencies, this builds on previous assessments conducted of the UN websites in 2020. A learning session has also been conducted for      IAITTF on accessibility of ICT services and operations. During the pilot period, several modifications have already been made to increase accessibility of the UN Nepal website since the assessment of 2020, these include: ensuring navigability of the website using keyboard; adding a feature for including AltText; allowing for increasing/decreasing font size; adding expandable search bar; removing accessibility barriers in terms of navigation; and including transcript features for audio files. 

In addition to the above, with recommendation from OMT, UNCT Nepal adopted standard languages on reasonable accommodation to be included for invitation to UN Nepal’s events and trainings/workshops and during recruitment in the vacancy announcements for written tests and interviews.

The OMT met in regular intervals, worked on their thematic work plan and monitored and reported on progress made towards the annual targets. This progress is captured and presented in the BOS annual review. To ensure the collaborative benefit and success, UNCT and OMT prioritised collaborative actions regularly.

Moreover, as a commitment on BOS, UNCT  authorized a 2.5 days dedicated workshop for operations staff to finalize  the review of BOS for 2022 and for providing training to operations staff . This workshop was attended by 51 participants from 16 agencies. UNCT also made the BOS online training mandatory for all staff involved in operations.

In the past years UNICEF ROSA’s data was clubbed under “UN”. Upon request from UNICEF ROSA, agreement from UNICEF Nepal Office and approval from DCO, data for UNICEF ROSA is clubbed with UNICEF Country Office for Nepal during this review.

Upon DCO’s decision, entities clubbed under “UN” previously were also segregated, this change impacted three agencies, UNRCO, UNDSS and UNV. From this year onwards, these three agencies have separate data included in the BOS.

Moreover, the team had to work on the data refinement as instructed by DCO to segregate individual agency’s data which was clubbed under one entity as UN. Three agencies RCO, UNV and UNDSS were added as collaborating agencies and relevant data was reallocated from UN to respective three agencies.

Based on the BOS review, the total cost avoidance for all common services as of 2022 is US$ 1.407 million, summary of each common services as per the table below:

Business Operations Strategy 2.0 for UN in Pakistan

This executive summary presents the UN Pakistan Business Operations Strategy (BOS) 2.0, a medium-term strategic plan and results-based framework that supports the newly developed UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF 2023-2027). The BOS focuses on joint business operations to eliminate duplication, leverage the UN's bargaining power, and maximize economies of scale. It is built upon benefits and opportunities arising from inter-agency coordination and cooperation on support services functions.

The BOS is structured around five common service lines: finance (including Harmonized Approach for Cash Transfers - HACT), human resource management, procurement, information and communications technology, and administration (including facilities management). The 2nd annual review focused on existing common services, and potential savings for BOS cycle 2 were projected at USD 4.2 million, with benefits realized during 2022 at approximately USD 0.8 million. (ref. table 1.0 below)

High-impact activities for the year were in common administration services and ICT service lines, resulting in significant cost savings. The OMT also piloted sustainable procurement policies in common LTAs, focusing on environmentally sustainable and socially responsible practices, and conducted quality assurance evaluations of external venues and accommodation facilities.

Regular budget requirements were identified to manage the OMT Secretariat, external job posting portal, HACT database, and tax consultant firm. Funding has been requested from UN organizations, funds, and programs comprising the UNCT in Pakistan, already included in the BOS planning framework.

The 2nd Annual Review did not identify any new common services solutions, but it was reported that the Job Posting solution (outsourced), resulted in realized benefits. Some common services solutions were put on hold, including conference and event management, CIPS training, and a few common premises management solutions that were discontinued for various reasons. The Mutual Recognition Statement has gained wider acceptability and is playing a significant role in sharing and utilizing LTAs across agencies. However, challenges remain in keeping track of various LTAs used by the agencies, hindering the ability to report cost efficiencies realized through piggybacking LTAs.

Las operaciones comunes del sistema de Naciones Unidas tienen como objetivo central garantizar que la entrega de la cooperación programática al país, en este caso Panamá, sea respaldada de la manera más efectiva y eficiente posible, asegurando un acompañamiento operacional oportuno y de alta calidad de parte de las agencias, fondos y programas. 

Para lo antes mencionado, es vital propiciar esfuerzos coordinados a través de una Estrategia de Operaciones Conjuntas (Business Operations Strategy - BOS), cuyo enfoque conjunto hacia la necesidad de proporcionar servicios comunes como un grupo de agencias (con evidencias duras en materia de reducción de costos o mejora en la calidad de los servicios), sea más relevante y significativo que el de proporcionar estos servicios como agencias individuales. De esa forma, también se demuestra lo mucho que se logra a través de la participación conjunta en la mejora y gestión eficiente de los servicios identificados como prioritarios.

El BOS del Equipo de País de Panamá (UNCT) ha sido elaborado gracias al apoyo, trabajo y compromiso irrestricto de los puntos focales que participan en el Grupo Gerencial de Operaciones (Operations Management Team – OMT),  y en este ejercicio se hizo evidente que a través de un abordaje unificado y estratégico, es posible maximizar nuestras fortalezas y ventajas comparativas en temas tales como adquisiciones, manejo de recursos humanos, uso de instalaciones, transferencias armonizadas de efectivo, entre otros.  

El BOS presentado cubre el periodo 2018 - 2021 (transicionando la información del documento aprobado en el 2018 a la plataforma BOS 2.0).  

Durante el 2021, el OMT se tomó la oportunidad de revisar, actualizar y analizar los servicios que en conjunto se requieren trabajar en el país. 

Durante el 2022, las agencias iniciaron sus procesos de licitación previstos en el working plan y/o el desarrollo de trabajos en conjunto.  A inicios del 2023, estamos evaluado el trabajo realizado.

Resumen Ejecutivo: 

En el primer bimestre del 2023, hemos realizado una revisión al BOS inicial, evaluando los logros obtenidos y los servicios. Hemos incluido un servicio que no se tenia previsto en el 2022, pero se logró, tal como el video de Staff Onboarding.

Queremos resaltar que, en el Panamá, los servicios en conjunto, en los cuales nos estaríamos enfocando serian en las áreas de Administración principalmente. Se prevé una evitación de costo estimado en $3.7 millones en un período de 5 años."
PER;Peru;375;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Actualización 2023 (revisión 2022):
Durante el año 2022, se dio continuidad a los procesos que estaban planificados en el BOS.  Algunos servicios fueron descontinuados, debido a que la pandemia trajo como resultado muchos cambios en la forma de trabajar, la virtualidad y la digitalización de muchos procesos.  Asimismo, el año 2022 vio un repunte sustancial en algunos servicios, como por ejemplo Viajes, los cuales crecieron a niveles similares a años anteriores a la pandemia.

Para el año 2022, se estimó un cost avoidance conservador de US$138,568 debido a los efectos de la pandemia, sin embargo, se alcanzó el monto de US$217,088, por arriba de lo estimado.  La meta de cost avoidance para 2023 fue ajustada, en base a la finalización de la pandemia, por lo que el monto que se espera tener es de US$277,807.

En años anteriores, todas las agencias agrupadas bajo UN reportaban como una sola agencia.  Ahora para 2022, se ha dividido en las agencias que lo componen, cada una con su reporte individual de gastos y cost avoidance.

Muchas gracias a todas las agencias que participaron, la información se encuentra completa.

Actualización 2022 (revisión 2021):
Se agradece a los miembros del OMT el esfuerzo realizado para la actualización de la plataforma, al contar con información de calidad y el su disposición para la implementación y uso de los LTA. Asimismo, a DCO por su soporte y esfuerzo para garantizar la calidad del proceso.  Especial mención a PNUD, ACNUR, UNESCO y UNICEF por llevar el liderazgo del OMT y del BOS a lo largo de todo el proceso.

Como resultado de la pandemia y los cambios del trabajo remoto, muchos de los servicios y oportunidades han cambiado de prioridad en función a los requerimientos de las agencias, por lo que muchos ahorros previstos no han sucedido, algunos servicios serán descontinuados.

La experiencia del BOS nos ha demostrado que es posible lograr economías de escala si los procesos son hechos con necesidades estandarizadas, de manera que todas las agencias puedan utilizar los LTA y no decidan luego hacer sus procesos individuales debido a que lo interagencial no cumple con lo que requieren.

Si bien los procesos interagenciales pueden tener resultados positivos, las regulaciones locales muchas veces impiden la firma de LTA o contratos marco debido a que los proveedores no aceptan los formatos de Naciones Unidas, por lo que algunos procesos no resultan en un trabajo colaborativo.

Es necesario considerar la distribución de costos de los procesos de compras y contrataciones, ya que muchas veces una misma agencia realiza varios procesos y el costo de hacerlo interagencial no es atractivo ya que no le representa ahorros.

Información 2020:
Hemos iniciado la migración de nuestra Estrategia de Operaciones Conjuntas (EOC o BOS, por sus siglas en Inglés), vigente durante el periodo 2018-2022, a la nueva plataforma en línea.
La Estrategia de Operaciones Conjuntas es un documento necesario para la planificación estratégica, el seguimiento y la información de las principales operaciones institucionales de los proyectos y programas implementados por la Organización de las Naciones Unidas (ONU) en el país. En el Perú, es el resultado del análisis de los procesos administrativos de todas las Agencias del Sistema de las Naciones Unidas (SNU) entre los años 2015 y 2017, realizado por el equipo de gestión de las operaciones Perú (OMT, por sus siglas en inglés) en el año 2018.

El presente documento se formuló siguiendo los lineamientos establecidos en la “Guía detallada para la construcción de un marco para la EOC”, la cual incluye la elaboración de la hoja de ruta, el análisis de las operaciones, la fijación de prioridades, la definición del marco de resultados, la validación de resultados con el OMT, el plan de trabajo anual y la evaluación por ciclo.

El desarrollo de cada una de estas fases ha requerido un trabajo articulado entre los miembros del OMT en coordinación con sus Agencias para el recojo de información primaria y secundaria, el análisis y discusión de la información proporcionada, así como el establecimiento de las recomendaciones que han orientado la redacción de este documento.

Cabe indicar que, de acuerdo con los criterios establecidos por el SNU, se ha considerado como creadores de valor indispensables a la eficacia, la eficiencia y el acceso a servicios de calidad para la evaluación y optimización de los servicios institucionales individuales y conjuntos.

En la fase analítica, se revisaron catorce servicios comunes y se logró identificar nuevos servicios de acuerdo con las necesidades de las Agencias. Posteriormente, en el análisis de costo beneficio se describieron los costos monetarios, laborales y los beneficios que existirán si se realizan acuerdos o contratos que optimicen los procesos de contratación de servicios.

La construcción de la estrategia refleja el método modular de desarrollo a través del marco de resultados donde se incluyen los cambios deseados en las competencias técnicas, la disponibilidad de nuevos servicios encontrados en las listas de transacciones y los indicadores de desempeño que permitirán medir y analizar sus avances, así como las herramientas de evaluación necesarias para el proceso de monitoreo y evaluación.

De esta manera, la estrategia apoya la implementación del Marco de Asistencia de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (MANUD) en el Perú, garantizando una confluencia entre los lineamientos técnicos y operativos de las acciones del SNU."
PHL;Philippines;411;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The Business Operations Strategy UN Philippines (2019-2023) outlines the strategic commitment to streamline common operations across the different agencies, while respecting their individual systems, processes and procedures. The Strategy’s timeline is synced with the Partnership Framework for Sustainable Development (PFSD) 2019-2023 and its revision to the UN Socioeconomic and Peacebuilding Framework (SEPF) for COVID-19 Recovery in the Philippines 2020-23 and represents another milestone on the UN Philippines’ Delivering as One roadmap.

The selected common thrusts under this Strategy relate to initiatives under Common Procurement, Common Services / Facilities Services, Common ICT, Common Human Resources and Harmonised Approach to Cash Transfers.

The operations analysis showed that there are already ongoing common initiatives that UN agencies have been undertaking since their previous location in Makati; and that in the short term, the relocation to the UN Common Premises in 2018 has already yielded cost reductions in some areas such as security (by 9%), janitorial services (by 41%) and rent (by 47%). Co-location of agencies provides more opportunities to undertake new common services. The secondary OMT in Mindanao provides additional strategic opportunities through which this BOS can roll out innovations for common operations in all field stations.

Under common procurement, UN LTA’s for Hotel Services, Communication Services (photographers, copy writers/editors etc.), Vehicle rental service, Event Management, Catering and Printing services will be developed. A Vendor Database Management system to act as a one-stop share- point for information on all UN vendors will be developed to strengthen inter- agency vendor-information sharing. UN Procurement staff will also regularly interface with UN vendors through structured “Know your Vendor” fora.

Under ICT, UN agencies will strengthen inter-agency ICT capabilities at the UN House, including harmonizing internet service provision, a joint UN Business Continuity Plan and a common room reservation platform.

Under Human Resources, the BOS provides cost saving opportunities for shared recruitment (where it makes sense to do so), joint staff training, common induction/orientation of UN staff will be undertaken with potential benefits for reducing lead times for staff on-barding, building staff-morale and enhancing teamwork.

Under common services, UN agencies in Philippines will explore a car-pooling initiative, outsourced vehicle rental services and the implementation of UN-wide green initiatives at the UN House in being consistent with sustainable aspirations underlined in the UN’s global agenda.

The main challenges for UN common operations in Philippines are threefold: the absence of comprehensive and comparable data among UN organizations on the resources devoted to these functions; the lack of baseline information on current levels of business operations efficiency; and the lack of clarity on whether there are operational requirements that may not be sufficiently met in a common service structure. Other constraints derive from different policies, procedures and systems within UN, the lack of direction and support from agency HQs and the high transaction costs of constructing local level solutions. Resource constraints especially for agencies with no management allocations further limit their participation in common operations. These factors further limit UN system coherence at the country level. Horizontal integration has also been limited by the existence of agency-specific regulations and rules, different enterprise resource planning systems and the predominance of vertical accountability over horizontal accountability.

However, there are substantial benefits and opportunities for efficiency gains with several agencies initiating creative gateways to surmount the challenges mentioned above.

For the immediate short term, the OMT will implement the common initiatives identified in this Business Operations Strategy at zero budget with the goal of first demonstrating the “qualitative dividends” from business operations harmonization.

The BOS is not limited to the initiatives identified but is elastic to accommodate any new operational requirements that may become necessary during the implementation timeline. Ultimately, the BOS provides a new outlook to common service operations that will enable the UNCT to regularly track the progress of common operations across UN Philippines in the short, medium to long term.

BOS 2022 highlights:
- Up to 70% cost savings due to collaboration on premises and other related services.
- Increased awareness and appreciation of benefits brought by BOS among UN colleagues.
- High quality of services (cleaning, security, internet, technical support) are maintained due to collaboration between agencies resulting to acquisition of suppliers with highest value for money
- Additional greening initiatives explored (e-waste)."
PNG;Papua New Guinea;373;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The Papua New Guinea Business Operations Strategy (BOS) 2020 – 2024 has been developed with the collaborative efforts of the Operations Management Team (OMT) and its working groups, under the overall oversight and support of the UN Country Team (UNCT).

The BOS 2020 – 2024 focuses on common services across the following six strategic priorities: administration and facilities management; human resources; ICT; finance; procurement; and, logistics. It provides the UNCT Agencies opportunities to generate a net estimated cost avoidance of USD 840,000 and services’ quality enhancements by working collaboratively. As part of the BOS review and prioritization , the UNCT has recommended that the OMT focus on disability access.

During the 2022 annual review, the total number of service streams under collaboration were streamlined to 21 and out of these, 6 were identified for cost benefit analysis.

During 2022, there was strong collaboration across agencies particularly in the use of long term agreement. BOS will be reviewed and updated yearly to ensure it remains relevant in changing country contexts and environments. In 2023, the implementation of the BOS will continue to have a strong focus on mainstreaming gender across common services as well as accessibility for persons with disabilities starting with the mapping of HR processes."
PRK;Korea, Democratic People's Republic of;253;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"This executive summary complements the Business Operations Strategy developed by the Operations Management Team in DPR Korea and is signed off by the Resident Coordinator with the endorsement of the UN Country Team, providing oversight for DPRK’s BOS 2.0.  

The Efficiency Agenda forms a component of the UN Secretary General’s proposal to reposition the United Nations Development System, within which all UNCTs were called upon to develop an improved Business Operation’s Strategy by 2021. The DPRK’s BOS 2.0 was developed complementarily to the global aim of a results-based framework that focuses on maximizing joint business operations, eliminating duplication amongst agencies and leveraging a common bargaining power of the UN. The principle of mutual recognition facilitates and constitutes a reliable evidence-based foundation for establishment of common back offices for shared services undertaken by the UN. The BOS can be structured around six common service lines:  Finance, Human Resource management, Procurement, Logistics, Information and Communications Technology and Administration including facilities management. 

In 2021, the DPR Korea’s BOS was developed amidst limited operational presence in country, owing to which common services identified are only essential in nature. The DPR Korea BOS 2.0 is focused on two service lines:

1. Common Human Resources: UN Clinic, will be provided for the UN medical and dispensary services lead by UNDP operations focal point; and
2. Common ICT Services: will be provided for ICT helpdesk; and local VSAT led by WHO and RCO operations focal points respectively. 

Specific targets are set by the Operations Management Team to ensure effective performance of each service offered, which will be evaluated annually. Each common service line has a designated implementation plan with a lead agency and focal person, as well as, identified risks and assumptions that have been weighed into the planning process. These common services are developed jointly or by one UN entity on behalf of one or more UN entities. BOS does not include or replace any individual agency’s operational plan. 

The cost benefit analysis for the Internet and VSAT services has been completed for all services, however, the figures reflected in the BOS 2.0 exercise will be on the Local Internet Service Provision jointly undertaken. In the Cost Benefit Analysis, the only independent (changing) variable will be that UN agencies are proceeding jointly versus independently. All other variables were maintained to compare “like for like” scenarios. 

During the BOS Annual Review in 2022 for year 2021, it has been concluded to postpone the implementation start date for the BOS from January 2023. Unfortunately, the operational scenario remains the same, the DPRK borders have been closed since January 2020. This is part of DPRK’s preventive measures to protect its population, by closing national borders. All UN international staff members have been working remotely from various locations and presently there is no UN international presence in the country, for over 2 years, therefore the DPRK BOS 2.0 is yet to be implemented.  

With the guidance of UNDCO, the DPRK OMT have decided to conduct a minimal DPRK BOS Annual Review for year 2022, where the CBA baselines and Quality KPI data were set to zero values indicating that the BOS will not be implemented in year 2023. And maintain the CBA baselines and Quality KPI data projections, from the first year of implementation 2024. The labor costs projections were rough estimates based on the potential costs for Helpdesk and VSAT services (staffing costs, procurement, recruitment, installation, maintenance services, transaction costs, etc.), divided amongst 7 UNAs if we all collaborate. It is noted that the unimplemented BOS cost and benefit analyses done in 2019-2020 needs to be reassessed, will need to developed further based on the recent country context and to include the labor costs in the next 5 years; when the UN international staff members are physically back in DPRK. And the implementation of the BOS activities: recruitment of a UN doctor only upon return of international personnel; consultations with UN medical services unit on certification of the clinic; orientation training among ICT specialists across all agency ICT systems and capacity access of the local internet service provider.

To conclude on the BOS annual review for year 2022, since there are no firm indications of DPRK border opening within year 2023, the OMT proposed to further postpone the implementation start date for BOS 2.0 from January 2024 (or until the return of international personnel in DPRK). The Operation’s Management Team in DPR Korea sustains its commitment to the further development of DPR Korea’s BOS and common service lines when it is feasible. "
PRY;Paraguay;374;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The Paraguay BOS focuses primarily on efficiency gains and cost reduction. It will reduce internal transaction costs and provide cost savings on externally sourced goods and services. The BOS will build on lessons learned and establish the means for a coordinated approach to “Operating as One” management mechanisms, and by systematically implementing established good practices for the transactions with the highest impact.

The BOS presents summaries of the operations analysis conducted; shows how the operations analysis provides the foundations for the results framework; demonstrates the causality and interdependence of the activities and outputs; and finally provides an implementation outline that will be incorporated into the Operations Management Team (OMT) annual work plan. The results framework provides measurable outputs, indicators and targets to assist the management, monitoring, evaluation and reporting of the identified common services.

Such common services will be implemented through lead agency activity, coordinated through the inter-agency working groups of the OMT, with the aim of improving the quality, cost effectiveness and timeliness of the UN System support to programme delivery and business operations."
PSE;Palestine;410;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The Palestinian political/security context make Palestine a difficult, challenging and unique environment to work in. Although recognized as one duty station, it has in fact three main locations (West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem) where UN agencies have their office presence.

The following agencies are represented within the Operations Management Team (OMT) and have contributed towards  the BOS process to varying degrees: UNTSO/UNSCO, RCO, UNRWA, UNDP, UNESCO, UNDSS, UNICEF, OCHA, OHCHR, UNFPA, WFP, WHO, UN Women, ILO, FAO, UNOPS, UNMAS, UNHABITAT, UNODC and UNIDO.

The UNCT provides overall oversight of the BOS process, approval and release of necessary agency and joint resources, sign off of the final BOS and annual reporting. The Operations Management Team and its subsidiary bodies are responsible to facilitate development and implementation of the BOS at the country level. 

With the launch of the BOS 2.0 platform, the OMT initiated the update of the platform in-line with its approved BOS. Due to the country context, the complexity of certain Long-Term Agreements (LTAs), varying agency mandates, and the impact of the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic, progress was hampered and delayed. However, in line with the UNCT approved BOS the cycle remained 2019 – 2022, to facilitate also future alignment with the new UNSDCF

During 2019-2020, 12 Common Services had been indicated as existing common services. In total, 28 common services are currently listed in the Opportunity Analysis, 6 marked as “do not include in the BOS” and 5 marked as “further analysis required”.

The updated CBA calculation undertaken in March 2023, shows a possible cost avoidance over the years 2019 – 2027 (in line with validity of the different common services) of US$ 1,995,657 (including those services that have been marked “do not include” or “further analysis required”). The realized cost avoidance up to the end of 2022 has been estimated at US$ 692,221.

The following areas continue to require prioritization as they contribute to potential cost avoidance:  
1)      Mobile Phone Services (split within the portal for two type of providers in line with different areas of the duty station)
2)     Travel Services (ticketing)
3)   Common Premises management (inputs reflect the benefit of occupying premises together, while figures are not to be understood as potential future savings). Further consolidation of presence of agencies in certain locations (West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem) is continually being discussed by the OMT as well.

The implementation of the Palestine BOS does not require an additional investment at this stage (original investment was related to the consultant which worked on the establishment of the HR roster in 2021). Implementation however continues to require the joint efforts of all agencies, in terms of providing requested data to feed into (LTA) processes and focused discussions, lead LTA establishment exercises and participate in joint evaluations in order to reach the maximum cost-efficiency, effectiveness and quality gains of all services.

RWA;Rwanda;152;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Rwanda implemented the Business Operation Strategy in 2022 with the overall aim of achieving greater impact by being coherent and effective in delivering development results and humanitarian support, while harmonizing business practices across agencies for increased efficiency.

The BOS focuses on UN support services that directly impacts the delivery of the UNSDCF and on those support services that are shared by multiple UN agencies and areas that the Operations Analysis has suggested can yield a high impact in terms of reduction of transactions costs and cost savings on externally sourced goods and services.

A Division of Labor model that allows the UN agencies to benefit from individual agencies’ residential expertise has been agreed upon. Overall, the OMT has identified five focus areas for Operations as One and assigned experts from the respective agencies to participate in Working Groups responsible for these focus areas. These five areas are Procurement, Human Resources, Finance, Information and Communication Technology and One House.

The BOS was implemented and operationalised through five (5) OMT Working Groups (Human Resources; Finance; Procurement; Administration; and ICT) under the guidance of the OMT to support joint planning, monitoring, and reporting for results. Activities planned under the BOS aim to improve cost effectiveness, quality, and efficiency of the UNCT’s support to programme delivery and business operations.

Each UN Agency is leading each pillar under BOSII rotational basis. In collaboration with the participating agencies, each lead agency is responsible for the implementation of activities assigned under each post. The following resident UN agencies participate in the Rwanda BOS – UN Women, UNHCR, WFP, WHO, FAO, IOM, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNECA and UN-Habitat. 

The United Nations system in Rwanda consists of 22 UN agencies, programmes, and funds, both 14 residents and 8 non-residents. Meantime for any non – resident UN agencies, projects/ programmes in the country and supported by UNDP, their CBA data and quality KPI data were captured by UNDP as an administrative agency/ service provider. UNDP continues to provide support payments to enable them to function in Rwanda for UNCDF, IFAD, UNDSS, UN Clinic, OHCHR, UN-HABITAT and UNV. The new Resident Coordinator is Mr Ozonnia Ojielo, the OMT chair is housed within UNDP.

The UNCT in Rwanda aims to save approximately US$ 4,126,691 over the UNSDCF cycle from July 2019 to June 2025 in efficiency gains and monetary savings. In 2022, the Rwanda cost avoidance for all categories generated by BOS II was US$ 1,602,295.

The UNCT members have committed to allocating financial and human resources to achieve BOS objectives and actively use mutual recognition as a veritable driver of the collaboration.

SAU;Saudi Arabia;379;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Saudi Arabia Strategic Cooperation Framework is intended to lead to a coordinated and substantive technical support by the UN agencies to the government of Saudi in it’s efforts to implement the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and addressing the context specific development vision- Saudi Vision 2030. The UNSDCF 2022 – 2026 has identified four Strategic Priority Areas for its support based on a comprehensive common country analysis and national development priorities: 1. People, 2. Planet, 3. Prosperity and 4. Peace and Partnerships.

To meet programming and policy priorities, the UNCT in Saudi Arabia intends to increase efficiencies, embrace innovation and improve quality especially in the business operations related activities. This includes opportunities for increasing efficiencies by reducing duplication, leveraging collective bargaining power and maximizing economies of scale. This all will be facilitated by applying the mutual recognition principle that was announced by the SG and agreed on among the UN agencies at a global level.

The Business Operations Strategy (BOS) comes to support the UN agencies in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in achieving faster and better results while ensuring the highest quality of services is provided. It will also help in better positioning the UN in the local market and increase it's visibility. The BOS in Saudi Arabia is focusing primarily on efficiency gains and cost avoidance. It aims to enhance internal transaction cost avoidance and to improve the quality of services, including cost savings on externally sourced goods and services.

The BOS was developed by the Operations Management Team (OMT) in close cooperation with the UN Country Team. It represents a simplified - yet comprehensive, integrated and coherent framework reflecting instruments for quantified cost-benefit analysis, results-based planning, monitoring and evaluation. The main challenges while developing the BOS were related to the level of engagement from the UN agencies in the country. For the resident agencies and since Saudi Arabia is a high income country the operational support presence is at the minimum level and  to determine the level of involvement from the non-resident agencies, who are being supported by UNDP

The BOS in Saudi Arabia, originally developed for a three year period from 2020 – 2022, is updated for 2023, and continues to focus on 3 common service areas at the first stage which are:

Administration: Harmonized servicing for common premises management, printing and stationary services for all UN agencies in the kingdom.  

Information Communication and Technology (ICT):     Common shared infrastructure at the UN House, LTAs for internet and mobile phone services are expected to result in a significant cost saving and also to improve the quality of service provision. 

Procurement:  at this stage only common vendor database to share

The 1st BOS of Saudi Arabia did not include many new or escalated opportunities due to the limited capacity available in the country and the COVID pandemic. However, the plan is to look into new opportunities while implementing this BOS and include them in the review or the next BOS.

The BOS was reviewed in Q1 of 2023, updated members, and agencies participating. New opportunities will be identified for 2022 to benefit the whole UN Team and facilitate operations. "
SDN;Sudan;385;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The UN in Sudan comprises 26 resident and 6 non-resident representatives of UN agencies, funds, and programmes (UNAFPs) respectively, whose work encompasses development cooperation and humanitarian assistance. In addition, there is currently one peacekeeping operation and one political mission in the country, namely the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) and the United Nations Integrated Transitional Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS) with field offices in a number of key locations. UN entities in Sudan work with numerous national and international partners to protect and strengthen the lives, livelihoods and fundamental wellbeing of civilians affected by conflict and natural disasters.

BOS 2.0 was prepared and endorsed by the UNCT in July 2020 and signed off by the UN Resident Coordinator in October 2020. It supports the collective response of the United Nations system to national development priorities in Sudan as outlined in the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (2018-2021), now extended until 2023, as the guiding strategic framework in the country (along with the Country Programme Documents of UNDP, UNICEF and UNFPA and WFP’s Country Strategic Plan). The UN Country Team in Sudan also agreed on a Common Approach document to guide the planning and prioritization until the end of 2023, to allow for the UN to have a common set of goals and priorities in the current environment. Furthermore, the Interim Cooperation Framework (2024- 2026) formulation process is now ongoing.  Sudan’s Business Operations Strategy (BOS) is formulated as a means to build efficiencies and quality into the operational work of the UN in Sudan and to align with the UN Secretary General’s vision for the UN reform agenda.

The current BOS 2.0 comprises 20 common services across all common service lines. 24 UN entities engage in the BOS, including the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator (RCO) and the World Bank. All common services, including high-impact common services presented within the BOS Sudan, are coordinated by the Integrated Operations Management Team (IOMT), comprising all UN AFP and UNITAMS, and directly managed by lead agencies of IOMT Working Groups (WG) as indicated in BOS documents. Quantitative and qualitative key performance indicators have been established to support annual monitoring of the BOS against established targets. Lead agencies of IOMT WGs are coordinating with all participating agencies to support full implementation of the approved plan and update the IOMT during its regular monthly meetings.

The overall cost avoidance is USD5.6 million contributed by 17 service lines. Common logistics services is the main contributor to a cost avoidance valued at USD 3.8 million, representing 68% of the total cost avoidance. This is followed by admin and finance services at USD0.9 (16%) and USD 0.6 (12%), respectively.

The IOMT under the leadership of the UNCT has focused its priorities on joint business operations and included multiple high-impact common service line items in the BOS to gain more cost efficiency, effectiveness and high quality of services for programme implementation in all Sudan for achieving the SDG objectives under SDG 17 which highlights global partnership in the areas of Admin, Finance, HR, ICT, Procurement and Logistics. Highlights of Working Group activities during the 2022 period and plan for 2023 is shown below.

The Human Resources Working Group (HRWG) plays a key role in harmonizing benefits and entitlements and in supporting IOMT on the preparation of requests for submission to ICSC. The Cost of Living and Local Salary Surveys were amongst the key activities supported in 2022. Common medical services provided by the UN medical clinic in Khartoum and the scaling-up of SUMAT services available at six deep field locations are amongst services yielding cost savings and enhanced staff well-being qualitatively. As part of the SDG 5 Implementation, a large pool of web-based intern applicants has been established and is readily available to participating agencies. The activities under HR services continued, apart from staff training services which were not conducted due to other competing priorities in 2022.

The Administrative and Finance Working Group (AFWG) continued collaborating in some BOS activities such as common premises and HACT activities where the HACT agencies benefited from the available LTA for micro assessment. Collaborating in cleaning and security services remained ‘Continue as is’ with no change as there is no change in the LTA. However, for future periods, some activities have been identified to maintain the collaborations and ‘Scaling up’ such as the LTA for Event Management and Conferences which is ready for use by agencies. Furthermore, , and with the exception of UNITAMS whose banking services are administered by Treasury in their headquarter office, an agreement was reached by agencies to have a Joint Procurement Activity for banking services in 2025 in line with the validity of agencies’ current banking arrangements until 2026. In addition to this, the service line on VAT Exemptions Refund needs has been discussed with the RCO to collectively approach the government with a request for up-front exemption.

The Procurement Working Group (PWG) maintained their activities in 2022 and will continue to implement the database for vendors and LTAs in 2023. The PWG committed to implement one more common procurement service “Central Database for Vendors.” This will provide the benefit to easily source qualified suppliers in a short-time, and to improve supplier performance management.

Similarly, the Information and Communication Technologies Working Group (ICT WG) maintained the collaboration on some ICT services, including connectivity and VSAT services as part of the common premises arrangement.

The Sudan Operation currently has no functional Logistics Working Group (LWG). Nevertheless, the logistics common services are being provided under a Service Level Agreement (SLA) by WFP to other agencies.   

Overall, the Working Groups aim to achieve the business efficiencies and effectiveness by reducing transition time and cost, meeting programmatic and administrative needs in a timely manner, benefiting from the best practices of other agencies, substantial reduction in overall operational costs, improving response time to programme delivery thereby solidifying the principle of One UN in the country."
SEN;Senegal;380;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The United Nations system in Senegal supports the country's development efforts through the implementation of the 2035 Emerging Senegalese Plan (PSE) and the 2030 Agenda of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is made up of 34 agencies, funds, and programs that are committed to working together to achieve the country's strategic priorities. It’s composed of 27 resident agencies with 9 non-resident UN agencies with responsibilities over the country. In addition to the RCO, the following UN entities are participating in the joint business operations: ILO, UNIC, FAO, IFAD, OHCHR, UNHCR, IDEP, ICAO, OCHA, IOM, WHO, UNODC, UNIDO, UN WOMEN, UN-HABITAT, UNAIDS, WFP, UNDP, ITU, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNOPS, UNDSS, UNCDF, UNV.

The UNCT in Senegal is fully engaged in the country's development through support to the priorities, plans and programs of the government, civil society, and other development partners. It's in this sense that it has recommended for more collaboration between Operations Management Team (OMT) and the Program Management Team (PMT). Through this collaboration, the OMT can provide technical support for economic environment analysis as well as implementation, where it can also collaborate on the use of data and evidence, as well as joint monitoring visits to improve quality assurance, risk identification and mitigation, and cost savings.

The joint business operations of the United Nations system in Senegal are also providing the necessary work for the smooth transitioning to a fully functioning Senegal UN House in Diaminadio planned for the 2023. Indeed, a great majority of the opportunities for collaboration in Senegal are related to the move of the UN agencies to the common premise of the UN in Diaminadio. The cost avoidance of the BOS in Senegal is impacted by the future realization or non-realization of the move, since many services with high added value are linked to this move. Under the leadership of the UNCT and the OMT team, the BOS focuses on joint operations and provides a strategic approach and results-based planning and management, as well as the implementation of harmonized programs to support operations throughout the country. In addition, improved delivery will be achieved through the use of long-term agreements (LTAs), jointly negotiated contracts with favorable rates due to economies of scale, and the use of common rosters to save time and maximize resources. Collaboration on cross-cutting issues in areas such as gender, disability inclusion, greening, data and digitization to improve data collection and analysis, and staff welfare will also be crucial to efficiently and effectively achieve the set objectives.

The current BOS in Senegal was approved by the UNCT and signed by the RC on January 30, 2021, and review in 2022. The current annual review of the BOS in Senegal under the leadership of the OMT has been possible thanks to the operationalization and functioning of five (05) strategic working groups: Administration, Procurement and Logistics, Finance/HACT, ICT, Human Resources. Although the OMT in Senegal faced some challenges during this first annual BOS review exercise, the involvement of all UN agency operations staff through their participation in the OMT working groups contributed to the success of the annual BOS review.  

Over this review period, a total of 46 existing services have been analyzed. The analysis revealed that 52% of the existing services are expected to be discontinued, 26% are expected to continue as is, while 22% of the existing services are expected to be ‘scaled up’. In terms of future collaboration, in addition to the 64 common services identified in the first annual review, including the 60 common services identified during the BOS development phase, 3 common services (benefits management, knowledge sharing, HACT audit) were added in the second annual review. After the review of the opportunity analysis, a final list of 31 common services have been kept and included in the BOS. These services cover the following: Common Administration services and including common Facilities/Premises (15), Common Finance services (3), Common Human Resources services (6), Common ICT services (2), Common Logistics services (2), Common Procurement services (5).

For a total cost avoidance estimated to USD 4,107,368 for the entire BOS cycle, USD 2,487,790 is actually realized from 2019 to present, with USD 687,052 in 2022. In addition, the travel service representing 63% of the avoided costs is to be considered as the high-impact service."
SLE;Sierra Leone;382;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Sierra Leone implemented the Business Operation Strategy in 2021 with the overall aim of achieving greater impact by being coherent and effective in delivering development results and humanitarian support, while harmonizing business practices across agencies for increased efficiency.

The BOS focused primarily on efficiency gains and cost avoidance while simultaneously improving quality of services, including cost savings on externally sourced goods and services and eliminate duplication of efforts, leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN and maximizing economies of scale.

The strategy is to focus on common services that are implemented jointly or delivered by one UN entity on behalf of one or more other UN entities. Common services in the following areas are identified for collaboration: Administration, including common Facilities/Premises; Human Resources; Information, Communications and Technology (ICT); Finance, and Procurement.

The UNCT is composed of 23 members, with 14 resident UN Agencies, funds, and programmes participating in the BOS, 7 non-resident agencies and 2 IFIs.

Resident Agencies: FAO, ILO, IOM, UN-RCS, UNAIDS, UNCDF, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNIDO, UNOPS, UNWOMEN, WFP and WHO.
Non-resident: IAEA, ITC, UNHCR, UNCTAD, UNODC, UNESCO and UNEP

IFIs: World Bank and IMF

Prepared through a highly consultative process with inputs from various UN Organizations in Sierra Leone, BOS aims to support effective programme delivery, monitoring and evaluation and reporting on common operations. The Operations Management Team (OMT) and its technical Working Groups within the various UN Organizations launched consultations throughout the BOS 2.0 development process to optimize the performance of their key functional areas of operations. The BOS, therefore, underscores key priority areas arising from these discussions, which are strengthened by a detailed operational analysis. Short and medium-term strategic results were also identified, that will guide the monitoring and evaluation of operations in the above mentioned six (6) common services during the programme cycle of Sierra Leone’s UNSDCF 2020-2023.

Designed to be a living document, the BOS was implemented and operationalized through six (6) OMT Working Groups (Human Resources; Finance; Procurement; Administration; ICT; Logistics), under the guidance of the OMT to support joint planning, monitoring and reporting for results. Activities planned under the BOS aim to improve cost effectiveness, quality, and efficiency of the UNCT’s support to programme delivery and business operations.

Following the BOS review, the total budget of the BOS collaboration has been revised from USD90,690 to USD211,691 over the five-year period with costs shared among participating agencies and funding on annual basis.

After the annual review on the achieved benefits and the BOS review process, the expected cost avoidance to be achieved during the 5- year period has been revised from USD1,288,301 to USD1,231,322 out of which cost avoidance of USD127,775 was achieved in 2021. Quality improvement is at the center of the BOS collaboration and this has been emphasized by the UNCT.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in 2020, the UNCT in Sierra Leone has given strong support to UN cares activities. As a response, the UNCT approved an Isolation Center for positive patients of COVID-19 of UN personnel and their dependents. Additionally, UNCT engaged a Stress Counsellor for the benefit of UN personnel and their dependents whilst the UN Clinic in Sierra Leone provide COVID-19 vaccination services to UN personnel and dependents. These activities are part of the medical services and dispensary common service.

Overall, during the 2022 BOS review, considerable focus was put on not only reviewing and assessing the services, but also developing a more detailed implementation plan with more specific timelines. Meanwhile, lead agencies and responsible persons for activities under each service were reviewed and updated.  

Gender responsiveness remains a high priority for the BOS. The OMT, with the support of UN Women and in line with the UNCT-SWAP gender equality scorecard’s recommendations, had introduced into the BOS four gender-related KPIs: Three in HR common Services (gender parity, women retained on the HR roster, gender trainings) and one in procurement (women-owned businesses on the vendor roster). Gender-Responsive Procurement Sourcing; and Gender Parity as new common services.

The UNCT members have committed to allocate financial and human resources for the achievement of BOS objectives and make active use of the mutual recognition as a veritable driver of the collaboration."
SLV;El Salvador;334;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The BOS 2.0 strategy is the result of a highly participatory, inclusive, and coordinated process among the technical and political levels of the United Nations System in El Salvador. The OMT completed the BOS annual review and continues working focused on the strengthened teamwork among OMT members and in obtaining the best value for money in the prioritized common services for 2023.

In terms of results, the BOS 2.0 was built on the basis of 4 pre-existing common services: 1. Travel, 2. Landlines, 3. Cellular and 4. Internet connectivity and VSAT services; and it was expanded in 2020 with 7 additional common services: 1. Accessibility to common facilities, 2. Catering, 3. Cleaning, 4. Conferences and events management of, 5. Environmental sustainability of common premises, 6. Printing, and finally 7. Maintenance of vehicles, which will be led by RCO, UNDP, UNICEF, WFP, FAO and UNFPA. In 2022 6 new collaborative services were included: 1. Consultant Roster, 2. HACT Management, 3. Vehicle Rental, 4. Vehicle Insurance, 5. Central Database LTA, 6. Central Database Vendors.

During the 2023 annual review one additional common services was identified: Outsourcing for specific temporary services; it is noted that this service is already a collaborative service that is being used by 3 agencies: WFP, UNWOMEN and UNFPA. In addition, UNHCR, IOM, FAO and UNWOMEN joined to 6 of the on going common services effective 2023.

This BOS 2.0 has been designed with a duration of 5 years aligning it to the new programming cycle of the Cooperation Framework 2022-2026 (UNSDCF). In financial terms, the BOS 2.0 estimates a cost avoidance of USD 1,556 M in 18 common services , and its implementation plan is budgeted in USD 5,400. The UNCT in its regular meeting on March 23rd 2023, endorsed the BOS 2.0 and approved the budget for the agencies to contribute to its implementation, which, in addition to bring economic benefits to the operation, will also allow strengthening and improving the quality of services from joint evaluations and feedback to suppliers.

SOM;Somalia;383;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"On the way to develop the present BOS, initiation of OMT members and working group members took place in October - November 2019. The OMT reviewed and endorsed the roadmap that was approved by the UNCT on 5 December 2019. From January to February 2020, the OMT organized working groups (WGs) with broad TOR as OMT technical arms, but with a focus on developing the BOS for their respective service line. The WGs met and elected their chairs. Unfortunately, COVID-19 came in March to slow down the momentum leading to a forced break till June 2020 as agencies were giving priority to their individual business continuity plans and adjusting their programs and operations to the new context. When the OMT resumed the development of the BOS, we quickly revised our roadmap and accelerated WGs’ sessions to work out the Stock Take and Opportunity Analysis including CBA that took the longest to complete until the Regional DCO assigned technical support to the OMT. 

The Somalia BOS has kicked off at the same time when the UNCT was launching the new UNSDF 2021-2025, hence the OMT used the opportunity to interact with the PMT during the process. The same timeframe has been therefore retained for developing common services across the six service lines. The conclusions of the BOS are: i) the total cost avoidance is foreseen in the amount of $ 28.6 million for the five years and the realized cost avoidance of BOS Somalia Annual review in 2021 is USD 8.5 million; ii) big ticket outcomes contributing to the cost avoidance are Common Logistics services and Common HR services, specifically Staff training services ; iii) collaboration for quality improvement and cost avoidance is enhanced through all outcomes; iv) a promising level of collaboration with 16 participating UN agencies on the most collaborative Common Services and 3 for the less collaborative. 

We look forward to more UN agencies joining the common effort as the BOS progresses to implementation and could demonstrate that with collaboration at operational level, the UN System in Somalia will be more efficient and achieve better impact of its programs. 

As we start the review process, it is important to mention the following development in the Somalia context that have impacted the implementation in 2021: i) COVID-19 has not ended, instead the country experienced new variants which jeopardized planned return to normalcy; ii) the UNCF and participating entities' country programs have been affected in terms of delivery rate by the delayed national elections and the political crisis that resulted; iii) the OMT has reflected on the need for mainstreaming environment protection activities in the BOS common services to be implemented from 2022; iv) the Common Premises agenda is a new priority for the UN in Somalia and the stoke take of existing ones has been completed in order to better to develop new CP as needs arise.  

In addition to the 16 UN entities that participated in the BOS from the first year, 7 new entities from the UNCT membership have been added as participating agencies from 2022.  "
SRB;Serbia;381;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The TCPR 2007 and the subsequent ECOSOC resolution on Operational activities of the United Nations for international development cooperation (2011) call for “identification and acceleration of the implementation of those business processes that promise the highest return from simplification and harmonization” and “encourages United Nations system organizations within their existing planning, budget and evaluation systems to report on their cost savings resulting from improvement of their business operations”1.

In addition, the ECOSOC resolution requests the UN to “explore further ways to enhance cooperation, collaboration and coordination, including through the greater harmonization of strategic frameworks, instruments, modalities and partnership arrangements, emphasizing the importance of ensuring, greater consistency between the strategic frameworks developed by the United Nations agencies, funds and programmes”2. Along similar lines, the Secretary Generals 5 year Plan of Action (2012) called for a “Second Generation of DaO”, providing continued focus on reduction of transaction costs and increasingly efficient business operations. This Plan of Action was supplemented by the Secretary General's Report in anticipation of the QCPR 2013-2016, which urged for enhanced analysis and strategic planning and reporting of the Harmonization of Business Operations at the country level3.

The UNDG strategic priorities seek to operationalize these mandates by emphasizing the need for efficient business operations through simplification and harmonization where it adds value in order to provide better support to development effectiveness and impact of programmes. With an aim to reinforce linkages between the UN Programme (Development Partnership Framework) and UN Operations, enhance operational monitoring, evaluation and reporting efforts of said harmonization initiatives, advance the harmonization of Business Operations at the country level as well as reduce transaction costs of UN Operations and enhance overall quality of operational support to programme delivery, it has been agreed to go for the Business Operations Strategy pilot in 10 countries worldwide.

The Business Operations Strategy (BOS) is a results-based framework, aimed at facilitating the strategic planning, management, monitoring and reporting of the UNCT’s joint support to programme delivery and business operations. In this sense, the BOS is an essential, but flexible and voluntary tool for UNCTs to support the implementation of their respective UNDAFs, regardless of their country context. The BOS aims to enhance the harmonization and simplification of the UN Agencies’ business operations at the country level, and therefore lead to improvements in the timeliness, quality and cost-effectiveness of operations activities, particularly in the fields of procurement, ICT, human resources, logistics, administration and finance.

The BOS guidance used to develop this document was adjusted in 2014 through the inputs of 6 pilot countries, and was reinforced with a toolkit including templates for quantitative analyses such as baseline and cost-benefit.

The BOS Serbia document has been shaped in a way to enable achievement of outcomes within five out of six Service Lines and has the target of avoiding costs of approximately 25%, as well as enable higher efficiency gains and quality improvements in UNCT's common services."
SSD;South Sudan;421;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The UN in South Sudan first developed a Business Operations Strategy (BOS) in 2019 to support efforts to deliver on its Peace-Humanitarian-Development assistance commitments.

The South Sudan BOS covers the UN system’s joint priorities in the areas of common operations for 2019-2024 with agreed common services in: Administrative and Logistics; Finance; Human Resources; Information Communication Technology (ICT) and Procurement. It builds on ongoing efforts by the UN system in country to harmonize and simplify its business operations and aims to address the gaps identified by the UN General Assembly in strategic planning, coordination and monitoring of the UN’s inter-agency operations and activities.

To date, under the BOS, cost avoidance amounting to USD 7.5 million has been recorded for the period 2019-2022 with the reported quality of those services also improving. These savings will be continued across the lifetime of the 2023-2025 UNSDCF, realised principally through reduction in recurrent costs and staff time for the acquisition of goods and services either through development of new joint Long-Term Agreements (LTAs) and/or piggybacking on existing Agreements.

Going forward, there will also be closer collaboration with UNMISS on BOS implementation and enhanced cooperation between OMT and PMT in particular for the scale-up of HACT. In addition, OMT will seek to further strengthen and streamline operations for reduced costs and improved quality on agreed common services. It will also explore opportunities for additional common services with high impact, such as initiatives on environmental, gender sensitive procurement and Common Premises."
STP;Sao Tome and Principe;378;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The UNCT in São Tomé and Príncipe consists of 6 physically present UN Agencies and the office of the UN Resident Coordinator (RCO): UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, WHO, FAO and WFP. The non-physically present representatives of agencies, funds and programmes signatories of the UNSDCF 2023-2027 are (ILO, UNHABITAT, OHCHR, UNESCO, UNODC, UNHCR, UNOHCHR, IFAD, UNEP, WMO, UN Women and ECA whose work encompasses development cooperation, humanitarian assistance. While each agency has programs and projects in accordance with its respective mandates, the United Nations Team is committed to ensuring that these programmes reinforce each other and provide optimal assistance to the country. The UNCT also maintains close cooperation with the WB, AfDB also signatories of the UNSDCF and IMF.

The UN São Tomé and Príncipe Business Operations Strategy (BOS) 2020-2025 is a medium-term strategic plan that focuses on Operations Management Team (OMT) support services to the São Tomé and Príncipe United Nations Cooperation Framework for Sustainable Development 2023-2027 which is the primary instrument for the planning and implementation of sustainable development activities of all UN entities operating in Sao Tome and Principe towards the achievement of the 2030 Agenda.

The aim of the common business operations at country level is to ensure programme delivery is supported in an effective and efficient way, ensuring lower cost of operations, improving quality, timely operational support to participating agencies. The means to achieve this is through coordinated efforts in the area of business operations and in the case of a Business Operations Strategy (BOS), a joint, common approach for a selected range of operational support services where there is a clear business case to provide (common) services as a group of agencies, rather than providing these services as individual agencies. This could lead to a clear, demonstrable benefit in terms of cost reduction and/or improved quality of services, realized by engaging jointly in the development and management of the identified common services, through Business Operations Strategy.

Six UN entities and the UN Resident Coordinator Office engaged in this BOS which involves 33 common services across all common service lines. The collective results expected from this BOS will support the implementation of the UNSDCF and help the people of São Tomé and Príncipe to live healthier, longer and more dignified, prosperous and secure lives.

Under supervision of the UN Country (UNCT), the Operations Management Team (OMT) provides leadership on the implementation of efficiency initiative on common business operations in a coordinated, efficient and effective manner at the country level.

Eric Jan Overvest, the UN Resident Coordinator is accountable to the Secretary-General for the development, implementation, monitoring and reporting of the BOS 2.0 and on steps towards development and implementation of a Common Back Office (CBO). The UNCT provides overall oversight of the BOS 2.0 process, approval and release of necessary UN Organizations and joint resources, sign off the final BOS 2.0 and annual reporting. The Operations Management Team (chaired by UNDP Operations Manager and its subsidiary bodies are responsible to facilitate development and implementation of the BOS at the country level.

Based on the assessment, a law rate of implementation was recorded as few activities were implemented and most of activities  were reported to 2023 to ensure the efficiency gains and enable cost-avoidance. It is also expect that with implementation of planned activities in 2023, the UNCT will be able to have considerable quality improvement of the received services and goods, uniformly reflected for all agencies and ensuring good value for money. While the overall impact will be the composite result of avoided costs, including staff time, and higher quality. "
SUR;Suriname;386;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"As part of the UN Reform, UN Agencies agreed that from 2021 on it becomes mandatory to have an approved Business Operation Strategy (BOS). The BOS focuses on joint business operations with the purpose of eliminating a duplication of efforts between UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes (AFPs) and to better leverage and manage common resources and the strength of the UN system on the ground to achieve economies of scale.  BOS was created in 2012 as a response to the call for simplified and harmonised processes and procedures across the UN system. The benefits of common services are becoming increasingly evident. The global Business Operations Strategy 2.0 (BOS), launched in October 2019, aims to deliver on the commitment for all UN Country Teams to develop an enhanced common business operations strategy by the end of 2020, in support of more effective programme delivery on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The BOS will also help leverage to meet the target set for all UNCTs to establish common back offices.

The UN Operations Management Team (OMT) in Suriname presented its first BOS Document in 2020, then its first BOS Annual Review in 2021, and now presenting its second BOS Annual Review for the year 2022. The BOS outlines the strategic direction of the UN business operations at the country level in support of the newly approved Multi-Country Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (MSDCF) 2022-2026. After one year of implementation the BOS Annual Review has now been completed.

The benefits of implementing the BOS include the enhanced linkages between ‘programme’ and 'operations’, reduced operational costs for UN AFPs, enhanced quality of operations, and an enhanced ability to monitor progress and track operational results. The business case has been assessed for each of the service lines to determine the current situation, the opportunities going forward and specific areas of efficiency including improved cooperation among agencies, cost savings on implementation and strategic use of existing and/or new mechanisms such as LTAs. These are all detailed in the Cost Benefit Analysis and Opportunity Analysis.

The BOS for the UNCT in Suriname has two main components which are the result of the narrative and the results framework. The preparation of the BOS Suriname UNCT began with a business operations analysis, which included the stock-take analysis, opportunities analysis, cost-benefit analysis (CBA), planning framework and the identification of risks and assumptions. During 2021 several activities were completed in the areas of human resources (staff well-being), common facilities and ICT services.

The stock-take analysis determined the performance and identified the challenges of existing common services helping to assess priorities for the BOS. The summary of the stock take analysis for existing common services is categorised under four of the six common services lines which were identified as relevant within the Suriname UNCT context:

1.      Common facilities services
2.      Common procurement services (Not Relevant for Suriname)
3.      Common logistics services (Not Relevant for Suriname)
4.      Common finance services
5.      Common human resources services
6.      Common ICT services

For the 2022 Annual Review, a few points should be noted.  1) During 2022, one new agency, IOM, was added to the BOS. 2) The agency, UN, was replaced with UN-RCO and all data transferred. 3) PAHO completely withdrew from the remaining service line, HR, staff well-being. 4) BOS Chair has continued to advocate for strong agency engagement in the BOS process.

From the BOS 2022 review, we can conclude that for all Suriname agencies, in total, there is a cost avoidance of USD 1.4 m for the five- year period. The cost avoidance for 2022 was estimated at $240,768 out of which $ 66,021 has been realized.

The highest impact service is management of the common premises, administration, with USD 14,904 as realized cost avoidance over 2022.

The Suriname BOS team has 172 key activities with 62 opportunities of which:    44 are completed; 56 are in progress; 72 not started; and 8 immediate actions are needed.

No new service lines are expected to be included for 2023 but 1 new common service has been added: Service Line Finance Services, Category - HACT and new Common Service of Macro Assessment."
SWZ;Eswatini;337;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Eswatini implemented the Business Operation Strategy in 2021 with the overall aim of achieving greater impact by being coherent and effective in delivering development results and humanitarian support, while harmonizing business practices across agencies for increased efficiency.

The BOS focused primarily on efficiency gains and cost avoidance while simultaneously improving quality of services, including cost savings on externally sourced goods and services and eliminate duplication of efforts, leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN and maximizing economies of scale.

The strategy is to focus on common services that are implemented jointly or delivered by one UN entity on behalf of one or more other UN entities. Common services in the following areas are identified for collaboration: Administration, including common Facilities/Premises; Human Resources; Information, Communications and Technology (ICT); Finance, and Procurement.

 The UNCT is composed of 18 members, with 11 resident UN Agencies, funds, and programmes participating in the BOS, 7 non-resident agencies.

Resident Agencies: FAO, IOM, UN-RCS, UN-DSS, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, WFP, UNESCO and WHO.
Non-resident: ILO, UNIDO, UNHCR, OHCHR, IFAD, UNEP and UNWOMEN

 Prepared through a highly consultative process with inputs from various UN Organizations in Eswatini, BOS aims to support effective programme delivery, monitoring and evaluation and reporting on common operations. The Operations Management Team (OMT) and its technical Working Groups (Procurement, HR, Facilities, Finance and ICT) within the various UN Organizations launched consultations throughout the BOS 2.0 development process to optimize the performance of their key functional areas of operations and uploading of data. The BOS, therefore, underscores key priority areas arising from these discussions, which are strengthened by a detailed operational analysis. Short and medium-term strategic results were also identified, that will guide the monitoring and evaluation of operations in the above mentioned five (5) common services during the programme cycle of Eswatini’s UNSDCF 2020 – 2025.

 Designed to be a living document, the BOS was implemented and operationalized through five (5) OMT Working Groups (Human Resources; Finance; Procurement; Administration (Facilities) and ICT), under the guidance of the OMT to support joint planning, monitoring and reporting for results. Activities planned under the BOS aim to improve cost effectiveness, quality, and efficiency of the UNCT’s support to programme delivery and business operations.

After the annual review on the achieved benefits and the BOS review process, the expected cost avoidance to be achieved during the 5- year period has been revised to USD348,011 in 2022. Quality improvement is at the center of the BOS collaboration, and this has been emphasized by the UNCT.

Overall, during the 2023 BOS review, considerable focus was put on not only reviewing and assessing the services, but also developing a more detailed implementation plan with more specific timelines. Meanwhile, lead agencies and responsible persons for activities under each service were reviewed and updated.  

Gender responsiveness remains a high priority for the BOS. The OMT, with the support of UN Women and in line with the UNCT-SWAP gender equality scorecard’s recommendations, had introduced into the BOS three gender-related KPIs: Two in HR common Services (women retained on the HR roster, gender trainings) and one in procurement (women-owned businesses on the vendor roster). Gender-Responsive Procurement Sourcing as a new common service.

The UNCT members have committed to allocate financial and human resources for the achievement of BOS objectives and make active use of the mutual recognition as a veritable driver of the collaboration."
SYR;Syria;217;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Syria’s Business Operations Strategy (BOS) is the direct response to the UN Secretary General’s Reform Agenda. The BOS enables the UN agencies to better harmonize their business processes using a structured framework that reinforces the principles of joint operations between the agencies. In line with the aforementioned, the BOS in the Syrian Arab Republic was triggered to provide a common approach for the OMT and UNCT to strategically ensure cost avoidance effectively through better coordination, consolidation and harmonization of the six common service lines namely Procurement, Finance, Human Resources, ICT, Logistics and Admin. 

The BOS for Syria will better equip the OMT/UNCT with the needed tools for delivering quantifiable results to all participating agencies. It also utilizes the already established common operations conducted in Syria; while ensuring further interagency coordination and collaboration proceeds accordingly, with the aim of truly Delivering as One. The adoption of BOS in Syria will also enhance compliance with donors’ expectations in terms of the utilization of funds, where operational costs will be clearly shown to be utilized efficiently and effectively.

Ultimately, all the improvements made to the Business Operations in Syria will further enhance the positive impact of the UN’s work both within Syria and worldwide.

In Syria, most UN agencies reside in one location in each geographical area, as a result forming Common Hubs in five different locations (Damascus, Deir Ezzour, Homs, Aleppo, Qamishli). In Damascus, some UN agencies’ offices namely (UN {RCO and UNDSS}, UNDP, UNFPA, UNHABITAT, and OCHA) are located in one Common Premises while UNESCO and UNRWA in one compound. 

Each Common Service line has a managing agency playing a lead role following up and assuring that the planned targets and key activities are met in accordance with what was set out in the BOS of Syria.

We are grateful to those involved in illustrating this roadmap including but not limited to the BOS Task Force, the OMT, and the invaluable contributions of the OMT Working Groups. This effort is especially well acknowledged during this extraordinary situation caused by the pandemic worldwide and its effect on the country. Syria BOS will serve as a compass for the OMT to refocus their joint annual work planning for delivering a coherent and integrated services strategy to all UN agencies in Syria."

TGO;Togo;422;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Summary EVALUATION BOS TOGO au 29.03.2023

La BOS 2.0 du Togo a été élaborée en 2020 dans le cadre de la mise en œuvre de la réforme des Nations Unies. L’horizon temporelle prévue était de trois ans pour s’aligner sur le Cadre de coopération du système des Nations Unies au Togo (CCDD 2019-2023). Ce Cadre de coopération a été écourté à la suite de la définition de la Feuille de Route Gouvernementale 2020-2025 qui est la référence actuelle pour tous les partenaires et leur cadre de coopération. La programmation de la BOS 2.0 pour 2023 intervient donc dans le contexte d’un CCDD 2023-2026 qui vient d’être signé avec le gouvernement et qui est organisé autour de trois priorités alignés sur les  axes stratégiques de la feuille de route Gouvernementale : (i)  Croissance plus inclusive génératrice d’emplois décents et renforçant la résilience des population dans un environnement durable, (ii) Capital humain et accès équitable aux services sociaux de base de qualité et inclusion sociale, (iii)Cohésion sociale par la promotion d’une gouvernance plus inclusive, efficace et redevable.

L’élaboration de la BOS a été guidée par une démarche participative ayant impliquée le personnel des opérations, du programme sous le leadership du président de l’OMT et a connu la validation de toute l’Equipe de pays. L’Equipe de pays au Togo est composée de 9 agences résidentes (OMS, ONUSIDA, PAM, PNUD, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNREC, FAO) concernées par le BOS et 12 agences non-résidentes (CEA, CNUCED, FIDA, HCDH, OIM, OIT, ONUDC, ONUDI, UNEP, UNESCO, ONUFEMMES, UNHABITAT).

La revue a permis de constater des changements au niveau des agences participantes. Ainsi, on note que 11 agences, fonds, programmes et bureaux participent à la BOS 2.0. : FAO, OIM, OMS, ONUSIDA, PAM, PNUD, RCO, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNREC. Cependant en raison de la non-disponibilité des données cette année, la participation effective de l’OIM et du RCO sera actée en 2024. Par ailleurs, pour les mêmes raisons, la participation de l’UNHCR est suspendue pour 2023.

Afin de mieux accompagner la mise en œuvre du programme pays du SNU, l’OMT a sélectionné 17 services communs au moment de l’élaboration de la BOS. La démarche de cette seconde revue a été de se concentrer sur les services prioritaires de la BOS.

L’OMT ayant déjà disposé de l’expérience acquise dans la collecte des données lors de la revue précédente, la démarche technique a été assez fluide malgré les conflits des programmes de planifications internes et la forte mobilité du personnel au sein des agences participantes. Une mini-retraite a été organisée du 15 au 17 Mars 2023 pour mobiliser les membres de l’OMT et ceux de groupes de travail de l’OMT, sensibiliser sur les processus de la revue BOS et pour pouvoir renseigner la plateforme avec des données de qualité.

Après revue des données, quinze (15) services communs sur 17 qui composent la stratégie existante, ont été mis en œuvre de façon active et effective conformément aux résultats de l’enquête de satisfaction qualité conduite le 17 mars 2023. L’OMT a réorienté le rôle de Lead pour les deux (2) services communs qui ont connu de retards dans leur mise en place et deux (2) nouveaux services communs ont été ajoutés aux services existants à savoir : l’infographie et la gestion des services d’accommodation et facilité des conférences.

A la suite d’un passage en revue des « services hautement recommandés » nous avons convenu :
-       de continuer de prendre en compte, la rubrique « counseling service », eu égard aux nombreuses sollicitations dans ce domaine ; et le résultat d’enquête de satisfaction qui a recommandé de maintenir ce service ;
-     de garder « la rubrique « prise en compte du genre dans les procédures de passation des marchés » malgré les difficultés à trouver les informations pertinentes sur des entreprises dirigées par les femmes ; mais des efforts vont être amplifiés en 2023, et
-      d’ajouter la rubrique de mapping des accès des personnes à mobilité réduite aux immeubles des réunions et conférence afin d’assurer leur bien-être et surtout leur jouissance des droits d’inclusion et de diversité.

Le service commun d’Infographie a été confié à UNFPA qui avait antérieurement en charge les activités d’impression et de sérigraphie ; tandis que les activités sur le mapping des accès des personnes à mobilité réduite aux immeubles des réunions et conférence ont été confiées au PAM comme agence lead en plus de la gestion des services d’accommodation et facilité des conférences.

Au total 21 services communs (dont 18 anciens et 3 nouvellement adoptés) ont été l’objet d’une évaluation approfondie pour assurer une mise en œuvre efficiente du programme et aussi identifier les couts évités lors de cette deuxième année d’exécution de la stratégie.

L’analyse coût-bénéfice a permis de calculer les avantages et bénéfices de ces 21 services communs, qui par la suite ont été retenus dans le cadre des résultats.

Au total, 201 activités clés ont été planifiées pour 58 opportunités identifiées. Le cumul du budget nécessaire pour la mise en œuvre de la stratégie est de 259 000 USD dont 12 000 restent à pourvoir. La revue a permis de constater que sur 201 activités, 93 activités ont été réalisées, 38 activités en cours d’exécution et 70 activités non-encore démarrées. Ces deux dernières feront l’objet d’accélération en 2023.

L’élaboration du cadre de résultats, plan de mise en œuvre et du budget a permis de retenir 5 effets, 21 différents produits attendus de la mise en œuvre du BOS (2021-2025) ainsi que les différents indicateurs de suivi et les ressources nécessaires à la mise en œuvre du BOS ont été estimés.

En général, la stratégie offre une projection des couts à éviter sur 5 ans (2021- 2025) qui s’élèvent à 2 482 265 USD par rapport à 2 142 026 de la revue précédente ; avec cumul des réalisations en 2022 de 44% par comparaison de 23% en 2021 du montant projeté. Le cumul de 1 097 280 USD est réalisé pour les deux années de mise œuvre de la stratégie dont 495 865 en 2021 et 601 415 USD en 2022 (soit 21%). Ces réalisations sont reparties dans l’ordre suivant selon les 5 effets de la stratégie :

1.      Services communs administratifs, les couts réalisés s’élevaient à 731 322 en 2022 par rapport à 317 756 dollars américains en 2021 ;
2.      Services des Finances, transferts de l’argent aux ayant droits à travers les prestaires financiers ou de télécommunications via service de technologie d’information : 70 571 en 2022 par rapport à 21 721 dollars américains en 2021 ;
3.      Services des Ressources humaines : 146 083 USD en 2022 par rapport à 93 121 USD en 2021
4.      Services de la TIC (téléphonie et connexion internet) : 162 682 USD en 2022 par rapport à 51 235 USD en 2021
5.      Services des Achats (gestion du carburant) : 49 622 USD en 2022.par rapport à 12 032 USD en 2021

Pour les projections des économies opérationnelles futures (coûts à éviter), au total, l’analyse coût bénéfice montre des avantages suivants : 

a.         Les projections ont été légèrement révisées à la hausse passant de 2 142 026 en 2021 à 2 482 280 USD sur les 5 ans en termes monétaire et en termes de gain de temps de travail du staff. Elles seront reconverties en gain d’efficacité et réinvesties sur les résultats de développement dans l’intérêt des plus démunis. Sur notre point de vue et la confirmation par l’analyse coût-bénéfice, les heures de travail économisées par la mise en place de différents arrangements et contrats communs vont être consacrées aux autres priorités du Cadre de coopération ; 
b.     Les 14 services communs administratifs produiront un cout à éviter quinquennal de 1 517 480 USD en termes d’avantages de collaboration consentie entre les agences participantes à ces services communs sur la base de leur volume d’affaires en maintenance des équipements de bureau et des véhicules, transport des marchandises, transitaires en douanes, infographie et impressions des documents, services de sérigraphie, production audio-visuelle, voyages, services de conférence et accommodation, services de nettoyage et services de sécurité des bureaux. 
c.     Des LTAs déjà mis en place en services de Téléphonie mobile et connectivité internet vont être mieux exploités par les agences pour bénéficier des économies d’échelles par leur utilisation maximale.
Ces nouveaux LTA dans le domaine de TIC permettront de booster la capacité globale de connexion globale des agences, mise en place de flotte mobile commune avec un coût à éviter estimer à 376 100 USD par 5 ans de mise en œuvre de ces services
d.    Dans le domaine des services Finances, les LTA sur la gestion des liquidités et transferts de ressources aux partenaires ont été retardés et seront mis en place pour servir les requêtes programmatiques dans ce domaine. Il est attendu de réaliser l’évitement de coûts jusqu’à 171 214 USD si les agences participantes mettent en place ces LTAs et optimisent leur utilisation.
e.      Dans le domaine des Achats et des Ressources Humaines, la mise en place de LTA de carburant et Rosters communs à plusieurs agences du SNU, permettra de générer des gains significatifs en termes de ristournes, soit 110 725 et 306 746 dollars américains respectivement.

Trois « services hautement recommandés » ont retenu notre attention et compris dans notre stratégie à savoir (1) staff counseling services, eu égard aux nombreuses sollicitations du Professionnel qualifié en thérapie psychologique et gestion du stress par les collègues du SNU ; et (2) prise en compte du genre dans les procédures de passation des marchés et (3) le mapping des accès des personnes à mobilité réduite aux venues des réunions et conférence afin d’assurer leur bien-être et leur jouissance des droits d’inclusion et de diversité.

La validation de la stratégie BOS par l’OMT et par l’Équipe pays a été faite le 24 mars 2023. L’OMT a collaboré de manière régulière avec l’équipe de revue qualité du DCO et leurs observations prises en compte et resoumises pour approbation le 24 mars 2023."
THA;Thailand;387;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The Secretary General’s UN Reform includes the coordination of UN Operations on the ground and in line with the Business Efficiency Agenda. To this end, at the request of the UN Country Team (UNCT) in Thailand, the Operations Management Team (OMT) developed its Business Operations Strategy (BOS) in 2020. 

The BOS promotes collaboration to eliminate duplication, leverage the common bargaining power of the UN and maximize economies of scale. It uses the principle of “mutual recognition,” which allows one UN entity to obtain services from another UN entity if the latter can facilitate these more efficiently. The BOS demonstrates how the UN system can save money and improve quality when we work together. 

Thailand is a UN Regional Hub that includes the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), Regional Agency Offices working across Asia and the Pacific, and the UN in Thailand comprised of the UN Country Team. Therefore, the OMT is comprised of staff from a total of 35 UN System entities in Thailand, collaborating across several common services as demonstrated by the stock take. While working together is not new, the BOS quantifies benefits. 

In Thailand, UN entities have collaborated across several common services as demonstrated by the stock take. While working together is not new, the BOS quantifies benefits. 

The OMT in Thailand has operations staff from 35 UN entities, at the country, regional and Secretariat level. Working on the BOS during the global pandemic presented challenges for operations personnel who needed to balance competing response priorities. 

The Thailand BOS is structured around core “common service lines”: Finance, Information and Communications Technology (ICT), Human Resources, and Administration & Logistics. It focuses on common services that are developed jointly or delivered by one UN entity on behalf of one or more UN entities, but it does not include or replace individual agency operations plans. 

After careful analysis of potential cost avoidance and quality improvement, an initial set of fifteen common services were selected for the Thailand BOS: four in Administration, three in Finance, two in Human Resources, five in ICT and one in Logistics. This does not mean that other existing common services are to be discontinued. Further analysis on those existing common services will continue in the next years and some may be added to the Thailand BOS later. 

If the BOS is implemented, the estimated cost avoidance will be approximately USD 4.6 million for five years (2021-2025). This estimate has increased from USD 1.5 million which was first projected on formulation in 2020. It is anticipated that using common benchmarks, indicators, terms of reference and monitoring of services will improve the quality of UN services. The BOS 2.0 platform aptly consolidates comparable data from different duty stations and entities. Lessons learned from both the development and the review of the Thailand BOS identified complexities due to the composition of Thailand’s OMT membership.  

To enable a quick capture of the benefits of Common Premises, it was agreed that for 2021, the ESCAP entity would report the benefits resulting in sharing common services connected to being in common premises. This includes building management and administrative services, utilities, custodial services, elevator maintenance, and building insurance. It was disaggregated in 2022 to allow for a more transparent reporting of cost avoidance by each relevant UN entity. 

OMT members continue to collaborate to implement the Thailand BOS and analyze existing common services for possible inclusion in the future. The BOS also leads to the ""next phase"" of the Reform, the Local Shared Service Center, formally referred to as the “Common Back Office"" initiative. This consolidates selected common services from the BOS and integrates them into a single country-level service delivery platform. Discussions at OMT on this are in their initial stages with Thailand slated by DCO for rollout in 2024. This is a whole new way of working together with lots of opportunities for synergies!

TJK;Tajikistan;413;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"OMT has developed and structured the country BOS framework around six common service lines as a basis for cooperation, including Procurement, ICT, Administration, Human Resources, Logistics and Finance. BOS was developed through the BOS online platform during second half of 2020 and was endorsed by UNCT end of December 2020. Annual review was conducted in 2022 and based on the calculations, the realized cost avoidance for 2022 is $203,639 giving rise to a year to date cumulative total for 2020, 2021 and 2022  equal to USD 716,369

Joint review of common services resulted to identification of 28 common services that will scale up common operations, reduce operational cost and enhance the quality of operational support to programme delivery and can be delivered by one UN entity on behalf of others translated them into a result framework to allow smooth implementation, monitoring and review/reporting.

The country BOS framework is also focused on improvement of planning, prioritization, decision-making, enhancement of monitoring and evaluation and generation of significant cost savings. The cost analysis shows the potential of efficiency gain of USD 1.4 mln.  through direct savings in goods and services, as well as indirect savings from labor and transactional costs in the following areas:
- Administration services including common Facilities/Premises, Stationary Procurement, Fuel Management and Security Services generating USD 877,689 of cost avoidance;
- Finance services where cost avoidance is expected to be USD 231,508 generated through cooperation in Banking Services, HACT management, Audit and Micro-Assessments;
- ICT services generating USD 130,125 benefit by cooperating in common service lines like Operational and Security Telecommunication services, Mobile phone services and Electronic signature;
-  Logistics & Procurement services where collaboration on joint LTAs, joint warehousing, Overland Cargo Transport and harmonized customs clearance should be generating USD 92,696;
- Human Resources with total amount of USD 73,995 cost saving/avoidance on Staff Training services, Benefits Administration, Local payroll processing, Job posting etc.;"
TKM;Turkmenistan;391;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"In accordance with the United Nations’ Secretary General’s vision for the UN reform at the operational level, and with the purpose to expand collaboration, to harmonize and simplify its business operations for efficiency gains, United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Turkmenistan developed its Business Operations Strategy (BOS).  The UNCT in Turkmenistan consists of ten entities: UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNODC, UN Women, WHO, IOM, UNDSS, UNRCCA and World Bank; UNCT has also some other non resident UN Agencies such as UNHCR, UNESCO, OHCHR (with one national staff located in Ashgabat who also participates in OMT). The online BOS version is built on the BOS developed originally in 2018.  

Early 2022 OMT under UNCT leadership has launched the BOS review process. During the review process the OMT has reviewed and hold a series of practical discussions about inclusion of new opportunities into the BOS and has opted for pragmatic approach in relation to changes in BOS.  The key changes include introducing a new agency to participate in BOS – OHCHR; update of the cost benefit analyses by all agencies and indication of realized cost benefits by each participating agency.  It is important to highlight that Turkmen BOS, agile and nimble, integrates a sizeable number of key services from the list of highly recommended such as management of common premises, management of conference and events facilities and some others. 

Another important factor to emphasize is that global COVID pandemic also has a negative impact on the working arrangements of practically all UN staff who spent many months telecommuting keeping in the office only few critical staff;  hence the physical attendance of the UN Building during several months of 2021 was limited. Still, of almost all sixteen BOS service lines were under implementation; and their progress and efficiency has been monitored and adjusted accordingly. 

UNCT and OMT will continue use BOS targeting cost reduction, improving efficiency and quality and looking for new opportunities and solution for joint collaboration that fit Turkmen context and maximizes common residence in one building. "
TLS;Timor-Leste;388;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The Business Operations Strategy (BOS) in Timor-Leste is an integral part of the Secretary-General’s UN development system reform agenda.  It is a results-based framework that focuses on joint business operations with the purpose of eliminating duplication, leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN and maximizing economies of scale.

The impact of UN programmes in Timor-Leste is directly related to the effectiveness, efficiency and cost of the operations that support them.  The main objective of this BOS, therefore, is to enable joint work and generate greater efficiencies, synergies and coherence required to implement the UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) 2015-2020.  The results achieved through the implementation of BOS 2.0. will be integral for the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 2021-2025 in Timor-Leste.

The UN House in Timor Leste was endorsed as UN Common Premises in 2012. Since then the agencies occupying the UN House are sharing the common cost, where most of the cost avoidance was realized. Therefore, the highest expectation of Timor Leste established BOS 2.0 is for quality improvement in all identified common services.

Timor Leste BOS 2.0 focuses on common services that are developed jointly or delivered by one UN entity on behalf of one or more other UN entities.  It does not include or replace individual agency operations plans.

Common services for collaboration were identified in the areas of: common administration services including common facilities/premises; common ICT services; and, common procurement services.  The following UN Agencies are participating in the Timor-Leste BOS: UN/RCO, IOM, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UN WOMEN, WFP WHO, ILO, UNCDF & FAO.

The UN Resident Coordinator (RC) is accountable to the Secretary-General for the development, implementation, monitoring and reporting of the BOS and steps towards a common back office.  The UNCT provides overall oversight of the BOS process, approval and release of necessary agency and joint resources, sign-off of the final BOS and annual reporting.  The Operations Management Team (chaired by UNDP) is responsible to facilitate development and implementation of the BOS in Timor-Leste, with coordination and support from the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office (RCO) and with additional guidance from the Regional Development Coordination Office (DCO).

The 2021 Annual Reporting process conducted by the OMT showed noticeable quality improvement in premises management and ICT Services hence it is decided to continue as is and/or scale up services. "

Eleven (agencies) participated in the BOS2.0 exercise in 2020.   They are ILO, FAO, IOM, PAHO, UN, UNDP, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNS- ECLAC, UNS-DGC.   In the case of UNICEF, the OMT representative is stationed in Barbados.  UNWOMEN has also joined the OMT subsequently. In total, 19 officials were engaged in the exercise as procurement specialists  from some organizations / agencies joined in the latter part to assist with the provision of information.  Additional staff joined from UNDP, ILO, PAHO, WFP, UNS-RCO and UNWOMEN. 

There were  eight (8)  Stock Take Activities: Travel Services, Plants Management, Meeting Room and Conference Facility Management, Cleaning Services, Security Services (outsourced), Pest Control Services, Parking Services and Help Desk.  Except for the Travel Services, most of the Stock Take exercise comprised services that were offered in UNDP House to the resident agencies.   

For the 2023 Review, we are pleased to advise that UNDP had established an LTA for Cleaning.   IT was decided that UNFPA will withdraw from the Working Group on Human Resources - Well being because they were no longer purchasing large amounts of PPE equipment.  As a consequence, we would have to discontinue with this Working Group. Whilst WFP  has joined the OMT, they  did not participate in  this exercise.  There was the reclassification of three  agencies, formally UN Recs  & OaHs.  They were ECLAC, UNIC and RCO .  They are now UNS-ECLAC, UNS-DGC and UNS-RCO  We have also made progress in the Implementation Plan for Accommodation and Events  and Conference facilities as well as banking and Photocopier equipment rental.

TUN;Tunisia;389;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"La Stratégie des Opérations de l’ONU (BOS) pour la Tunisie est à sa deuxième année de mise en œuvre, depuis son lancement en décembre 2020.

Pour l’année 2022, un certain nombre d’activités ont été réalisées avec la participation des quatre groupes de travail, les groupes Ressources Humaines, Finance, Administration/logistique et Achats. Le processus de la revue annuelle du BOS 2022 vient d’être lancé, avec des Webinars proposés par DCO, et devra être clôturée le 31mars 2023. Certains services, notamment la création des LTAs, a permis d’éviter des coûts.

En adoptant cette stratégie, l’équipe pays a marqué son engagement pour la réalisation des priorités du Secrétaire Général des Nations Unies visant à garantir une gestion efficace des ressources à travers la mise en place de services communs pour l’ensemble du système des Nations Unies. Le BOS pour la Tunisie rend ces objectifs quantifiables et permet un suivi continu des progrès et une évaluation des coûts et de la qualité des services communs.

Il existe 4 sous-groupes pour la mise en œuvre du BOS, il s'agit de l'Administration, des Achats, des Ressources Humaines et de Finance. En 2022, les réalisations des groupes se présentent comme suit:

Groupe Procurement 
- Plateforme des LTAs: 4 LTAs sur les 7 ont été renouvelées ou créés,  
-  Opérationnalisation de la plate-forme de partage des LTAs accessible à toutes les agences.

Groupe RH 
- Roster commun de consultants: Plateforme est opérationnelle et accessible aux points focaux des agences participantes 
- Support à 2 enquêtes intérimaires : Support à la finalisation de l’EI de 2019 & conduite de EI 2021

Groupe Admin/Logistique 
- Fleet-tracker inter-agences: une plateforme de covoiturage commune de gestion des déplacements (gestion responsable de la flotte). Bien qu’existant, la pateforme n’est pas utilisée par toutes les agences. Un effort devra être fait par le groupe pour la vulgariser
- Formation sur plateforme: Utilisation de la plateforme au profit des agences participantes

Groupe Finances
- Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfer (HACT): Mise en place d’une base de données Base HACT: la base de données est en cours de finalisation.
- Création d’une LTA pour les sociétés locales d’audit : les Termes de Références ont été validés.

TUR;Türkiye;390;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"In accordance with the Secretary General’s vision for the UN reform at the operational level, the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Turkiye developed its Business Operations Strategy (BOS). The BOS covers the UNCT priorities in the areas of common operations for 2020-2024 and builds on ongoing efforts by the UNCT to harmonize and simplify its business operations and aims to address the gaps identified by the UN General Assembly in strategic planning, coordination, and monitoring of the UN inter-agency operations activities.

The present BOS aims to introduce new opportunities for collaboration and initiatives for UNCT for the next five years. The BOS is developed by the five OMT working groups (Procurement, ICT, Administration, Human Resources, and Finance). Following the methodological steps in the BOS platform to identify unaddressed needs, explore possible opportunities, and prioritize those based on a cost-benefit analysis.

All the initiatives in the BOS are the results of the ongoing business operations in the five (5) common thematic areas of the BOS. Common services already exist in each of the following areas: Procurement, ICT, Administration, Human Resources, and Finance. Selected initiatives were translated into a result framework to allow monitoring of progress throughout the stated five years.

The objective of the BOS is to further improve the quality, timeliness, and cost-effectiveness of the UNCT’s operations. It is expected that a full BOS implementation during this five-year cycle will result in cost-avoidance of USD3M in total as net benefits through efficiency gains in goods and services procurement, labour costs, as well as from avoidances in expenses (following a rather moderate estimation and approach).

The savings derive mostly from common negotiation of joint Long-Term Agreements (LTA), thus saving staff time and leveraging the common negotiating power leading to receiving better value for money and enhanced quality of service. Besides the above-mentioned benefits, a positive side-effect, which has been commonly identified by all OMT members participating in the development of the BOS, was the synergies developed - the spirit of common collaboration and the dynamics to boost further interagency cooperation. There are already other activities, which are not included in the BOS, but have been and are being developed, and the momentum that has been created through collaboration should neither be undervalued nor lost.

Finally, the proposed initiatives require minimum or no monetary investment, but the staff time dedicated to the joint effort and agencies’ commitment reflect the importance of an empowered OMT.

Successful implementation of the BOS in Turkiye requires a continued high level of commitment and support from the UNCT and OMT, as well as a steady coordination and monitoring mechanism that will allow for the gradual reduction in transaction costs and reduced duplication of operational support to programme delivery."
TZA;Tanzania;394;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"In 2007, the United Republic of Tanzania was among the eight pilot countries of Delivery as one with the overall aim of achieving greater impact by being coherent and effective in delivering development results and humanitarian support, while harmonizing business practices across agencies for increased efficiency. The key elements of the pilot were: One Programme, One Leader, One Office, One Budget, One Voice (subsequently renamed Communicating as One).

In 2012, the One Office became Operating as One with the launch in 2012 of the Business Operations Strategy (BOS), which in 2016 was integrated to the UNDAP II (2016-2021) as non-programmatic activities.

As part of the UN reforms, the UNCT and OMT decided to revamp the existing Operating as One in BOS 2.0, starting 1 January 2020 by reviewing the relevance of existing collaboration and identifying new opportunities of collaboration. Among the already existing 35 collaborations, the OMT proposed in 2020 BOS to discontinue two services and identified seven new ones.

In 2022, it was proposed to discontinue one service under Human Resources on staff on boarding and add a new one under Finance Services. In total 49 common services are now included in the BOS across the five working groups. While procurement does not have most services, it represents the lead Working Group as it supports most of administration and ICT services through establishment of LTAs.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in 2020, the UNCT prioritised UN cares activities. The OMT developed a UN duty of care plan including all 23 AFPs, which was fully endorsed and funded by UNCT. This plan was integrated to the BOS. During the 2022 annual review, the staff welfare plan included vaccinations and COVID-19 testing services. These activities are part of the medical services and dispensary common service.

In addition, considerable focus was put on reviewing and assessing the services, as well as developing a more detailed implementation plan with specific timelines. Meanwhile, lead agencies and responsible persons for activities under each service were reviewed and updated. IRMCT and the RCO are reflected in the BOS under the UN. OHCHR and UNCTAD, as non-resident entities are not part of the BOS. The total number of participating agencies is 21.  

The review led to an increased integration of the leave no one behind principle into the BOS. The following six new services were added: Reasonable Accommodation for Persons with Disability; Recruitment of Persons with Disabilities; Staff Training and Activities for Disability Inclusion; Accessibility in Procurement Services; Mapping of Accessible venues; and UN accessibility plan for the one UN house in place, as part of mapping existing physical accessibility in premises.

Gender responsiveness remains a high priority for the BOS. The OMT, with the active support of UN Women and in line with the UNCT-SWAP gender equality scorecard’s recommendations, introduced four gender-related KPIs in 2020: three in HR common Services (gender parity, women retained on the HR roster, gender trainings), and one in procurement (women-owned businesses on the vendor roster). In addition, the OMT decided to add PSEA – Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse; Gender-Responsive Procurement Sourcing; and Gender Parity as new common services.

Environmental sustainability was integrated into the BOS under a new service Environmental Responsive Procurement Sourcing. In addition, aligned with the UN Youth Strategy, new activities on youth and internships were included under existing Human Resource service lines.

The total budget of the BOS is USD 2.2 million. In general, the costs are shared among participating agencies and activities are funded on annual basis.

Following the annual reporting on the achieved benefits and the BOS review process, the expected cost avoidance to be achieved during five years (January 2020-December 2024) is USD 4.8 million. Of this, USD 2.2 million cost avoidance has been realized so far. Quality improvement is at the centre of the BOS collaboration, and this has been particularly emphasized by UNCT.

The UNCT members have committed to allocating financial and human resources for the achievement of BOS’ objectives and ensuring the active use of the mutual recognition."
UGA;Uganda;392;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Consistent with the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) resolution requiring the UN to explore ways to enhance cooperation, collaboration and coordination while employing the sense of urgency in streamlining its business processes with the hope to reduce transaction costs and demonstrate operational efficiency; and in accordance with global best practices, the UNCT, through its Operations Management Team (OMT), set out to develop this business strategy (BOS). The BOS is a results-based framework that focuses on joint business operations with the purpose of eliminating duplication, leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN and maximizing economies of scale.

The UNCT in Uganda, consisting of 29 UN entities and the UN RCO and those with physical presence in country as well as those who do not, developed BOS 2.0 in 2020 with the overall aim of achieving greater impact by being coherent and effective in delivering development results while harmonizing business practices across agencies for increased efficiency.

There are twenty-two (22) UN entities and the RCO with physical presence in country and seven (7) who are non-resident. Those with physical presence in Uganda are FAO, IFAD, ILO, IOM, OHCHR, UNAIDS, UNCDF, UNDP, UNDSS, UNESCO, UNFCCC, UNFPA, UN Habitat, UN RCO, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNIDO, UNODC, UNOPS, UNV, UN Women, WFP and WHO. The Non-resident entities are IAEA, ITC, UNCTAD, UNDESA, UNDRR, UNECA, UNEP.

The BOS 2.0 in Uganda focuses on common services that are implemented jointly or delivered by one UN entity on behalf of one or more other UN entities. Common services in the following areas are identified for collaboration: Administration, including common Facilities/Premises; Human Resources; Information, Communications and Technology (ICT); Finance, and Procurement. As for the logistical services, OMT in UN Uganda has a working group where collaboration among agencies is starting in 2022 to be reported in the next cycle of review.

In the BOS2.0 Review in 2022, revisions were made mainly in the following areas, resulting in the reduction of the overall cost savings from Uganda for 5 years.

- UN Uganda conducted the review with fresh eyes and detailed analysis of contractual status in a participatory manner on the volume of contracts and expenditures (both realized and projected). In the process, some of the errors in the previous submission were also rectified, including “labor cost” where several agencies previously reported “expenditures” instead of “number of purchase orders”.
- UN Uganda, through a fully inclusive approach, had scrutinized areas where real collaborations are taking place to generate actual savings.

Through the process, it has clearly emerged that “LTA for Fuel” and “Internet Connectivity and VSAT” are the two major areas making the highest impact through collaborations, followed by “Travel Services”, “Conference and Event Management”, and “Mobile Phone Services”. 

The total estimated cost avoidance of Uganda is revised from USD 21.1 million USD to USD 2.7 million during the BOS annual review. In 2021, the UNCT was able to realize USD 1.7 million of cost avoidance.

The submission reflects the areas of the collaboration as well as projected figures more clearly than the previous BOS. It is also noted that most collaborations were found to be among those UN entities who are resident in Uganda. The review process itself also further helped to deepen knowledge of system-wide collaboration among participating agencies. The enhanced understanding on the efficiencies gains as well as options available for mutual recognition identified from the review process in the areas of logistical services, are expected to bring about the positive future behavioral change among UNCT in exploring and expanding collaboration in coming years. The UN in Uganda is also committed to allocate available human and financial resources to the continued implementation of the BOS 2.0."
UKR;Ukraine;30;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"BOS was developed as a solution for simplification and harmonization of the UN system. It is one of the key pillars of the UN Reform initiated by the UN Secretary-General to ensure the achievement of the efficiency targets through the overall estimated cost reduction of USD 310 mln.

The impact of the UN programmes in Ukraine depends on the effectiveness, efficiency and cost of the operations that support these programmes. BOS is a critical tool to reinforce this link within the Ukraine complexity context that combines emergency and development elements. BOS is a results-based framework focusing on joint business operations to eliminate duplication, leverage the common bargaining power of the UN and maximize the economies of scale.

The Ukraine BOS runs parallel to and complements the UN-Ukraine Partnership Framework 2018-2022. The strategy was developed with the full participation of the OMT members, and it has received full endorsement of the Heads of UN Agencies here in Ukraine. The Operations Management Team (OMT) in Ukraine is well established and has an active Common Services portfolio.

Ukraine BOS focuses on the common services which are implemented jointly. It looks into Common HR, Administration, Finance, ICT, Procurement and Logistics Services. While many common services have been successfully implemented by the UN in Ukraine for more than a decade, which testifies to the solid business operations framework in action and delivering effective results, the Ukraine team looked into new efficiency solutions during the opportunity analysis discussions, which would contribute to quality delivery of the Ukraine UNSDCF. The BOS focuses primarily on efficiency gains and costs avoidance and aims to enhance internal transaction cost avoidance while simultaneously improving quality of services, including cost savings on externally sourced goods and services.

The Document is structured around 6 key result areas namely Admin and Logistics, Facilities Services, Finance, Procurement, ICT, and Human Resources. It focuses primarily on efficiency gains and reduction of costs. Through its proposed inter-agency activities, it is estimated that this BOS will achieve cost efficiencies of nearly US$5.5 million in total during the 2018-2022 cycle. By making the joint operational effort more efficient, less resources are used for day-to-day operations and more can be dedicated to assist with programmatic delivery.

While the BOS is originally designed to interface with the UNSDCF; taking programmatic requirements and translating these into impact on the operations effort, this BOS framework does not take programmatic requirements into account, as the Ukraine UNSDCF remains at the very broad outcome/output levels – i.e. without information that the OMT can translate into practical, operational impact and incorporate into the BOS outcomes. A BOS that engages a more detailed UNDAF may be considered in the next BOS/UNSDCF cycle.

That said, the OMT expects that successful implementation of the current BOS framework will indirectly support the Ukraine UNSDCF. By making the joint operational effort more efficient, less resources are used for day-to-day operations and more can be dedicated to assist with programmatic delivery. "
URY;Uruguay;395;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The Business Operations Strategy (BOS) is a key component of the Secretary-General's UN reform which seeks to reposition the UN development system through enhanced cooperation and collaboration across the UN and improved quality and efficiency of joint business operations. 

Uruguay Country Team developed its first BOS document in 2020 which mainly aimed at strategically improving the quality and efficiency of existing common services while identifying new opportunities in key development areas to bring a more integrated and efficient UN Country Team. 

The main objectives of the BOS are:
- Strengthening the links between programme and business operations by developing high quality and cost effective support services;
- Improving planning and implementation of joint business support services;
- Reducing operational costs by eliminating duplication, maximizing economies of scale and simplifying work processes across the UN.
- Improving the quality and timeliness of operational support to programme delivery.

The development of the BOS document has been a consultative and collaborative process under the coordination of the Operations Management Team. The first version of the BOS counted with the participation of 14 UN agencies, funds and programmes. The planning exercise was carried out from July to December 2020 through the following six OMT working groups:
- Human Resources - coordinated by UNFPA.
- Procurement - coordinated by UN Women.
- ICT - coordinated by UNESCO.
- Finance - coordinated by UNDP.
- Administrative Services and Common Premises - coordinated by UNICEF.
- Logistics - coordinated by UNIDO.

For the purpose of stocktaking the existing common services within the UN System, the analysis conducted only considers those services provided through local service level agreements (SLAs) or LTAs with service providers that were jointly established by more than one UN agency. Therefore, the assessment does not include any services provided through corporate agreements at HQ level or LTAs from single UN agencies that are available for piggybacking through mutual recognition principles. Following this approach, the BOS document brings a real picture of current collaboration and integration of UN operations in the country and becomes a valuable tool to define an action plan to achieve higher collaboration and synergies for the UN Country Team, in addition to the existing mutual recognition of processes across the UNCT.

Since 2022 the Country Team has conducted annual revisions of the BOS with the objective of monitoring progress on the implementation of agreed common services, reporting on the benefits and quality improvements achieved, as well as identifying new areas of collaboration and integration to strengthen Country Team operations. 

The latest version of the BOS counts with the participation of 19 UN agencies, funds and programmes, which are collaborating in 31 service lines, with 71 identified activities that are completed and/or in progress. From such collaboration, the UNCT estimates cost savings for approximately USD 120,000 by 2025, of which USD 36,000 have already been materialized.

UZB;Uzbekistan;396;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"UN Country Team (UNCT) in Uzbekistan has agreed to develop Business Operations Strategy (BOS) for 2018-2020 within the existing United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) between the Government of Uzbekistan and the United Nations System for the period 2016-2020. The BOS Roadmap as developed y Operations Management Team( OMT) reflecting the UNCTs collective agreement to jointly lead and resource a BOS process. The BOS Roadmap was developed according to the principles of effectiveness, efficiency, access to services and quality, moving from mechanical compliance to risk-based approach. 
It should be noted that many UN operations in Uzbekistan are already delivered in the spirit of Deliver as One. But there is a need to build on existing expertise and expand into areas that have potential to yield significant gains in terms of money, time and efforts. 
The BOS preparation process was kicked off with a 2-day workshop on October 11-12 in Tashkent. An extended team of OMT members, UNRC office personnel, as well as international and national consultants attended the workshop. The workshop not only familiarized participants with the concept of BOS and general framework, but also allowed participants to develop common understanding regarding the BOS process. 5 sub-groups in finance, procurement, human resources, IT, admin/logistics.

The subsequent cost-benefit analysis (CBA) identified relative pros and cons of each service line and allowed to prioritize new services. CBA showed that the overall impact of the new common services, proposed as a result of the needs and opportunities analysis, is estimated to bring the net total benefits in the amount of US$245,000 by 2021.

UNCT and OMT have also committed to the BOS end-of-cycle evaluation that will be synchronized with the final evaluation of the UNDSAF 2016-2020. It will assess the level of the BOS targets achievement against key performance indicators in terms of costs avoided and quality enhanced. The evaluation will consider the organization, coordination, relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability of the BOS, highlighting lessons learned and providing recommendations for the next common business operations cycle.

OMT has conducted BOS Annual Review and has also worked on new BOS common areas for cooperation as detailed below.

Uzbekistan is a strategically important country that has a strong UN presence with a sizable program and operational outlay. In total, it has 13 UN agencies with a total staff strength of about 250 personnel.  Despite Covid’s negative impact on the work of the UN during last two years, growth of UN operations is expected to pick up again from 2022 onwards. Implementation of BOS in Uzbekistan that started in its first phase in 2018 and 2019, continued until the end of 2021. A detailed evaluation of the existing BOS achievements is being undertaken by the OMT and it is expected that majority of planned activities were undertaken in a successful manner despite the pandemic. . In parallel, the OMT started working on BOS 2.0 towards the end of 2021. The process of BOS 2.0 was kicked off with a one-day online workshop in mid Oct that was attended OMT members, key members of the operations team of UN agencies, and some members of the UNCT. The participants were briefed on the new BOS 2.0 requirements and online platform. In order to work on BOS 2.0, five groups were formed, namely: Procurement, Finance, Admin & Logistics, HR and ICT.  Group members reviewed the existing activities under ongoing BOS and identified some new areas of collaboration. Following the kick off meeting, a comprehensive consultative process took place ,  performing an in-depth stock take of existing collaborations and identify new areas of collaboration that were considered crucial for the operations in the country. In addition, due consideration was given during the identification process to include as much as possible the “highly recommended” and ""SDG impact"" status services as listed in the BOS 2.0 platform.

Despite year end closing that directly impacted many participating staff, consultative process continued, and groups agreed that 12 existing services included in the exiting BOS will continue under BOS 2.0 with some minor adjustments. Two services were agreed to be discontinued due to its minimal monetary and qualitative benefit. Groups also identified 15 new common services which included many “SDG Impact” and “highly recommended” services such as evaluation of UN venues for ensuring access to persons with disabilities (PWD) and conducting a review of UN offices for their accessibility to persons with disabilities. At the same time, Procurement agreed to incorporate gender responsive procurement practices, especially encouraging women owned businesses to participate in the UN procurement bids. Also, it was agreed to collaborate on ""green IT"" that ensures that all disposal of IT equipment is done in an environmentally friendly manner. The new collaboration will ensure disposal of older equipment according to environmental recommendations. Finally, ECMM evaluation of UN Offices will be undertaken to reduce use of energy resources and related costs. Though, most of the collaborations will be performed using existing resources  some of these services will require an investment ranging between $3,000 to $20,000 to be shared among participating agencies over a period of 3 years. However, these services will bring a major improvement in quality of work of the UN in various domains as well as achieve cost avoidance of about USD 300,000 during the years 2022-2024. 

The implementation of these services has been distributed over three years to ensure full potential of these services remains attainable. The majority of the existing and new services will start implementation in 2022, while the remaining 7 new services will be implemented from 2023. It is expected that implementation of these services will not only bring considerable improvement in quality of UN operation but at the same time infuse a spirit of working as one among the participating agencies.

OMT Uzbekistan has started Annual Review exercise of its BOS strategy for year 2022 and has held its first meeting with participation of several new UN agencies such as IOM and UNOPS. OMT WGs are reviewing the common activities planned for 2022 under the guidance of the OMT and the BOS regional advisor. OMT will review the works of 5 WGs- HR, procurement, Admin-Logistics, Finance and IT and will present Annual Review results of BOS of 2022 to the UNCT review and endorsement by the end of March 2023.

VEN;Venezuela;423;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The Business Operations Strategy (BOS) is a results-based framework that focuses on joint business operations with the aim of eliminating duplication, leveraging the UN's common negotiating power, and maximizing economies of scale. 

Venezuela's BOS roadmap began with an introductory workshop in March 2020 for OMT members and members of the six working groups, resulting in an approved strategy on February 03, 2021. 

The implementation of the BOS over the next three years aims to support the UNCT in establishing quality and cost-effective common services, serving as a fundamental support for the advancement of the activities, programs and projects of the different agencies, specifically in the Cooperation Framework, which in turn will result in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

In this regard, the United Nations Country Team in Venezuela, together with the OMT and its six Working Groups have reviewed the strategy and report that by 2021-2022 results were obtained in the Logistics team with a benefit of USD 142,675 since the agencies achieved an interagency LTA in their three (3) services identified as harmonized customs clearance, overland cargo transport and storage and warehouse management services, being the first working group on developing an LTA in group. In this sense, a benefit of USD 1,095,609 is projected to be achieved during the strategy. 

In the case of Procurement, Administration, and ICT services, it is reported that according to the eight (8) services incorporated and projected to be implemented in 2022, the teams did not obtain benefits for the past year after the non-generation of inter-agency LTAs. Nonetheless, agencies change their services leaders to launch the process of LTAs and have them for 2023. 

The Finance working group maintains only two (2) services; and Procurement working group maintain the use of two (2) databases corresponding to LTAs and vendors, which are an important input for the agencies' day-to-day operations. 

As for new services incorporated in this review, the Human Resources working group incorporated a new service called Common Internship Programmes, which seeks to develop and promote internship and volunteer programmes in compliance with LNOB task force, in order to reach up to 2% of youth workforce representation in the organization, thus encouraging Leaving No One Behind

In summary, seven (7) services were re-subjected to a cost-benefit analysis (CBA), which resulted in an estimate of avoided costs of USD 3,113,649 in the remaining four (4) years of the strategy, resulting in a relevant increase after the incorporation of new agencies in the strategy as is the case of IOM, OCHA, OHCHR, PAHO and WFP in procurement, administration and logistics services; as well as updated projections of all agencies involved after the reactivation and increase of their operations in the last year. The other services do not result in cost savings but focus on improving the quality of service to an average level 4 on a scale of 1 to 5. 

The UNCT has expressed its commitment to move forward with the BOS in Venezuela, with the objective of achieving an agile, efficient and effective UN.


Working groups comments
Although the BOS has brought good opportunities in terms of generating spaces for the exchange of information and experiences for their operations, they express the importance of recognizing more the work done by each focal point of the working groups in carrying out the BOS strategy and to dedicate a workspace to achieve the planned joint services to obtain better or greater benefits through joint work. 2022 was a year of great experiences and learning in terms of harmonizing teamwork and duly planning services according to the working and operational capacities of the agencies.  For this reason, in this review there are no major changes to what was stipulated in 2021 since the teams wish to conclude and achieve the proposed objectives and results, to incorporate new opportunities in the next reviews, always having as a transversal guide the objectivity to achieve the expected results in the stipulated time."
VNM;Viet Nam;397;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The Viet Nam BOS represents the efforts of the Operations Management Team (OMT) in Viet Nam as supported by the UN Country Team (UNCT) to establish a strategic framework for common business operations. With the participation of all UN resident agencies in Viet Nam (FAO, IFAD, ILO, IOM, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNDSS, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHABITAT, UNICEF, UNIDO, UNODC, UN/RCO, UNWOMEN and WHO), it was developed in alignment with the Viet Nam Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 2022-2026. This BOS considers lessons learned from the previous year BOS. Following DCO guidance, items being currently managed by the Vietnam Common Back Office Unit including common services established to meet the specific needs of agencies based within and outside the Green One UN House (GOUNH) are not captured in this exercise. It shall be reported separately.

The BOS Review exercise for 2023 follows DCO annual review methodology which provides the OMT with the tools to monitor and review its approach to remain relevant and updated by data and analysis provided by the OMT working groups.

The OMT and its working groups assessed all common services across the six strategic priority outcomes and for this year is focusing in 3 areas listed below:
- Common Procurement
- Common Human Resources
- Common Finance

Following the track of the successful previous BOS cycle, the Viet Nam 2023 BOS aims to consolidate the country improvement of business operations, ensuring timely and professional programme delivery by continuing leveraging the common position of the UN, strengthening efforts to reduce duplication of processes and staff time, while maximizing economies of scale. Calculations were prepared by the OMT WGs and cleared by OMT members based on the pre-approved CBA Methodology which aligns with the DCO BOS Framework. Data presented are estimates conducted by the WGs’ members based on their knowledge on the business processes of their own agencies and several assumptions. However, considerations were raised by the UNCT on the validity of the CBA methodology requiring in depth discussions and alignments. These data, therefore, may not necessarily reflect the actual costs avoided by individual participating agencies, but provide an evidence-based analysis that help WGs to decide the way forward and prioritize common services.

We also would like to register the UNCT and OMT team concerns on the BOS 2.0 limitations and technical glitches which made the overall process not as efficient as it should.

UN Vietnam stands ready to organize or to contribute to a learning session with other UNCTs/OMT to exchange experiences on BOS 2.0. There is an urgent need to understand structural challenges at the field level and to urgently improve our collective ability to achieve operational efficiencies. Concretely, we need to better define and capture “savings” and continually adapt our methodologies and metrics in this important endeavor."
WSM;Samoa;377;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"In December 2017 the UN Secretary-General (SG) issued a proposal to reposition the United Nations Development System. For business operations, the SG included a requirement for all UN Country Teams (UNCT) to comply with an improved Business Operations Strategy (BOS) by 2021.

 The BOS focuses on joint business operations with the purpose of eliminating duplication, leveraging the common bargaining power of the UN and maximizing economies of scale. It is facilitated by the principle of “mutual recognition” and it constitutes a reliable evidence-based foundation for the establishment of common back offices. In short, the BOS supports the development of harmonized business operations to achieve enhanced linkages between programme and operations, reduced costs, enhanced quality, enhanced operational focus and prioritization, and enhanced ability to monitor progress and track results.

 The BOS is a document that outlines the medium-term strategic focus of United Nations business operations at the country level in support of programme implementation. The BOS is structured around a choice of six possible lines of common services (Common Administration Services, Common Logistics including Common Facilities/Premises Services, Common Human Resource Services, Common Finance Services, Common ICT Services and Common Procurement Services). All such services contribute to the aim of simplification and harmonization of business practices in the UN system.

 As is the practice to establish separate working group consisting of personnel with the different specialty along these service lines to carry out the necessary tasks, OMT Samoa established five working groups merging Administration and Logistics led by UNESCO, HR working group led by UNDP, Finance working group led by FAO, ICT working group led by UN/RCO and Procurement working group led by UNFPA. However, having noticed that it was the same OMT members participating in all the five different working groups and the demand and additional burden this has created, instead of having separate sessions for each working group, OMT agreed to convene one BOS meeting and go through the tasks under all working groups at the same time.

 With this arrangement, OMT Samoa identified twenty nine service solutions under the Common Administration/Logistic including common facilities/premises service line, five  service solutions under the Common Finance service line, three service solutions under the Common Human Resources service line, six service solutions under Common ICT service line and one service solution under Common Procurement service line, both new and existing services that are of interest for exploring possible future collaboration.  However, several of these services require better understanding, technical input and further analysis before inclusion into BOS including premises related services that are already in place and currently being provided by UNDP to agencies hosted in the one UNH that will continue without change for now.

The OMT Samoa selected an initial set of four common services under the Common Administration and Logistics Services (Consumables Procurement, Insurance Services, Stationary Procurement, and Catering Services) in consideration of the continuous demand for these services by participating UN Agencies and the potential cost savings and quality improvements that can be realized through collaboration and harmonization of these services.

It is to be noted that this BOS is the first one developed for Samoa. None of the OMT members had the opportunity to attend the formal training provided by UNDCO in the region. Furthermore, many of the agencies present in Samoa are headquartered in Fiji, a separation that reduced the commitment of some agencies to completing the process. However, local OMT members educated themselves by reading BOS guideline documents and following recorded sessions of online webinars as trainings are held at a time not convenient for Samoa. Colleagues in DCO have been very helpful in responding to queries and providing guidance whenever necessary in the BOS development.

In addition, as mentioned above, OMT Samoa does not have distinct working group members to take responsibility in all of the different BOS common services. Thus, the same OMT members, composed mainly of operations and programme staff, worked on all five common service areas to develop the Samoa BOS. This, of course, hinders the delivery capacity of the OMT due to lack of support from qualified and experienced staff required in the specific areas of the different common services. The lack of staff added significantly to the workload of OMT members and the time it has taken to complete a process. This challenge was also one of the reasons that OMT chose to first focus on common services that are under Administration Services. Additional to the variables mentioned above, the market is Samoa presents constrains for the development of commercial agreements, such as small market, or unavailability to commit to long term agreements due to the shortage of materials and labour or the unstable costs of goods.

 Although the focus for now will be on achievement of cost and efficiency gain through the setup of these common services mentioned-above, it does not mean that other existing common services will be discontinued. However, further analysis on both existing common services as well as newly identified potential common services will continue throughout the life of the BOS cycle and services could be added to the BOS accordingly.

In 2022, bids were submitted for the aforementioned four services. The joint procurement for stationary, and insurance services, moved forward. However, the following services presented challenges: Based on the needs assessment analysis, the OMT members put this action on hold and reconsidered it, as the variety of models may not yield cost-effective results; instead, security services were added, which was successfully completed in 2022. Despite multiple attempts, the service-related catering had failed due to the suppliers' inability to maintain prices due to Samoan market conditions. In addition, as part of the annual review, the Samoa OMT conducted a brief survey among its members and determined that there is a need to build a central database for LTAs and vendors, as well as to work on rate harmonization among UN agencies. Furthermore, the Samoa OMT has collaborated with the Fiji OMT to develop a common shared drive so that UN agencies have access to LTAs from both nations.

Through collaboration on these services, a cost savings of US$ 352,883 (three hundred and fifty-two thousand, eight hundred and eighty-three dollars) is anticipated over a period of five years. In addition to the US$352K from the four service solutions included in the BOS, there is a preliminary estimate of US$700K for sixteen service solutions that require further analysis, as well as an estimate of $804K for twenty-four service solutions that are not currently included in the BOS but will be revisited periodically for inclusion in the BOS with greater clarity.

Annual Review Exercise Update-2022

The OMT members discussed the work progress of 2022 and agreed that the risks identified during the BOS development are evident during the procurement processes. Although the office established the joint LTA for stationery, the OMT did not see a material cost saving due to economies of scale. We were not able to secure the LTA for catering services as none of the vendors committed the price for long term. As a result, this service line could not be concluded.

The OMT will try again in 2023 with a new approach to establish the LTA. FAO and UNDP also agreed to collaborate on Conference and even management service lines to explore and establish the LTA in 2023. The OMT in the year will also explore other service lines that were identified as “Further Analysis Required” to explore if any joint collaboration could be done in the year.

YEM;Yemen;415;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"Yemen remains the world’s worst humanitarian crisis with 80 per cent of the population in need of humanitarian assistance. The current humanitarian response is severely underfunded (42 per cent), forcing the United Nations (UN) and other humanitarian actors to scale back and/or shutter live-saving activities. The situation risks further deterioration as the conflict continues to take a heavy toll on the population. The country is being pushed closer to widescale famine because of the ongoing fighting, access restrictions, insufficient import of vital goods, a serious economic crisis, and the impact of COVID-19.

The United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Yemen will develop a new UN Programming Framework for 2022 – 2023 which will supersede the current UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) 2012 – 2020. This Business Operations Strategy 2021 – 2023 enables the UN Country Team priorities in the areas of common operations not only to be aligned with the current UNDAF but also to provide the necessary framework to support the new Programming Framework 2022 – 2023 by joint working arrangement in business operations with increased efficiencies, cost effectiveness and innovative quality solutions.

Building on common approach by the UN Country Team in harmonization and simplification, this Business Operations Strategy [BOS 2.0] captures 5 common areas: Administration, Finance, Human Resources, ICT and Procurement with 61 common services and around 10% to scale down, 10% scale up and 80% continue as is. The successful implementation of Yemen BOS 2.0 will include the harmonization of relevant administrative processes, reducing of duplication, further improving of service quality, and achieving cost avoidance in the targeted common services.

Based on the BOS annual review, the realized benefit/cost avoidance for 2022 is about US$8.63 million while the estimated cost avoidance for 2023 is estimated to be about $6.43 million"
ZAF;South Africa;384;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"The UNCT in South Africa developed its first BOS in 2017 which expired in 2019, coinciding with the expiration of the extended UNDAF. In February 2020, as part of the new country cooperation framework, the UNCT in South Africa decided to embark in the development of the BOS following the new guidelines and tasked the OMT to lead the process and established the BOS Task Team to lead the process. The South Africa BOS 2.0 strategy is informed by the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 2020-2025 (UNSDCF 2020-2025) developed in consultation with the Government of South Africa and various stakeholders, including the Civil Society. The UNSDCF 2020-2025, is aligned to the Government’s Medium-Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) 2019-2024 and focuses on four of its seven priorities: transform the economy to serve the people; advance social transformation; strengthen governance and public institutions; and South Africa for a better Africa and world. The UNSDCF focuses on four strategic priorities as entry nodes for an effective, relevant and sustainable contribution to accelerating the Sustainable Development Goals in South Africa: inclusive, just and sustainable economic growth; human capital and social transformation; effective, efficient and transformative governance; and climate resilience and sustainable natural resource.

The UN RCO and sixteen UN agencies committed to work together in pursuit of the strategic priorities laid out in the UNSDCF 2020 – 2025 towards achieving the SDGs in South Africa. Out of nine non-resident UN agencies two, i.e. UNEP and WFP, are participating in the BOS and seven are not participating in the BOS and these are: UN HABITAT, UNESCO, UNESCO SA, WORLD BANK, IFC, IFAD, and IMF. The UN resident agencies including UN RCO and participating in BOS are: FAO, UNDP, ILO, IOM, UNODC, UNAIDS, UNFPA, UNIC, UNICEF, UNHCR, WHO, UNIDO, UN WOMEN and UNDSS.
 
In the year 2023 the OMT aims to effectively support delivery on all the 17 SDGs thus the OMT has prioritised high impact indicators that support delivery of SDGs expected results. Some of the high impact indicators identified include: Inclusion agenda (Disability, Gender equality and women’s empowerment and Youth), Greening initiative, Innovation: Data and digitalisation. Through the inclusion agenda, the OMT will support delivery of results for SDG5 on Gender Equality for example through ensuring gender balance Human Resources and gendered procurement;  SDG 10 Reduced Inequalities through Implementation of practices that encourage inclusion of all irrespective of gender and disability; SDG 8 Decent work & Economic Growth through ensuring implementation of career growth and development opportunities and activities for all personnel. The OMT has also prioritised delivery of SDGs through implementation of high impact indicators greater adoption and use of improved technologies such as internet connectivity services and mobile phone services. Through the greening initiative the OMT will contribute towards SDGs 7 which seeks to promote access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy and SDGs 13 on combating climate change and its impacts.  Furthermore to ensure the delivery of results, the UNCT places value on health and staff wellbeing thus the OMT has established a Wellness Working Group and this will contribute towards Goal 3 on ensuring healthy lives. The wellness committee will provide services to all UN staff and beneficiaries, thus creating a health human resources pool to deliver on all the 17 SDGs.    

The OMT has prioritised delivery of the SG’s efficiency agenda through implementation of BOS, Common Back Office and Common Premises. Through the implementation of BOS, the UNCT achieved cost avoidance of USD 717,904 in the year 2020- 2021 and  the expected cost avoidance up to the year 2025 is USD 1.5M. This is to be achieved through collaboration in implementation of 21 common services of which 10 common services are under Common Administration Services including Common Facilities and Premises. Two of the common services are under Common Finance Services, 5 under Common HR Services and 5 under Common ICT Services. In addition to the cost avoidance indicator the UNCT, has also prioritised quality improvement indicators across the Common Service Lines. To support effective and efficient delivery of the UNSDCF the OMT will work through 6 OMT Working groups and these are:

Human Resources WG: The group prioritises conducting salary surveys, providing HR support to COVID-19 response, providing staff counselling services and health awareness programmes to staff and dependents. The group collaborates with the Wellness group.

Greening the Blue WG: The group is focused on raising awareness on the importance of sustainability throughout the UN. Group activities support collaboration on green energy projects and reducing the carbon footprint of UN SA staff and dependents.

Budget (Finance) WG: The group is focused on ensuring the efficient and effective management of the financial resources of the common services portfolio. The group supports the development, monitoring and reporting on the common services and local security cost shared budget.

ICT WG: the group focuses on harmonising ICT services, standards and processes of UN agencies while also aiming for the maximization of return on ICT investments made by agencies. Key activities include the establishment of an ISP LTAs as well as the development and implementation of the Common Business Continuity Plan.

Procurement WG: The group is focused joint procurement services and identifies goods and services that are common to agencies in supporting the implementation of their programmes. Such services include security services, banking services, mobile phones services etc., through the establishment of LTAs. The group aims to prioritise gender responsive procurement and environmental responsive procurement.

Wellness WG has prioritised offering comprehensive preventive, promotive, curative, mental and physical health for all staff and eligible dependents. The group collaborates with the HR group."
ZMB;Zambia;416;2024-01-01;2024-03-31;"In Zambia, 2022 represented the second year of implementation of the Business Operations Strategy (BOS), which was developed at a critical juncture for the country, falling between the end of the Partnership Framework (2016-2022) and the preparation of the first ever UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) covering the period 2023-2027. 

In 2022, the implementation of the BOS has been accelerated with a 450% increase in the number of fully implemented common service lines from two (02) in 2021 to eleven (11) in 2022. However, the realized cost avoidance for 2022 is $67,637, about 46% decrease from 2021, bringing the overall realized cost avoidance for the period 2021-2022 to $192,519 i.e.  9% of the 5-year period cost avoidance (both monetary and staff time converted in monetary terms) of $2,154,575. This means that there is much work to be done to achieve the full implementation of the 33 common service lines and achieve the expected cost avoidance. It requires all Technical Working Groups (TWGs) working hand-in-hand to develop cost-effective and realistic strategies and viable options to accelerate especially the implementation of the remaining eight (08) common services with their projected cost avoidance. 

Over the past two (02) years, the expected results were not fully achieved due to the following main challenges: 
· Strengthening the accountability for the active participation from UN agencies, in particular, non-resident agencies;
· Setting up realistic cost avoidance in the Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA).

In order to address these challenges, the Annual Review Exercise for 2022 agreed to remove nine (09) entities from the BOS implementation (Funds and Programmes: UNCDF, UNCTAD, UN-HABITAT, UN-Women; Specialized Agencies: IFAD, IMF, UNIDO, World Bank; Other UN Entities: UNECA) with sixteen (16) entities continuing the implementation (9 Funds and Programmes: IOM, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNODC, UNOPS and WFP, 4 Specialized Agencies: ILO, FAO, UNESCO and WHO and 3 other UN entities: UNDSS, UNIC and UNRCO). 

While the BOS platform has maintained a 5-year period for all service lines, the OMT is expected to review the timeframe of implementation of all service lines in 2023 to align the BOS activities with the implementation of the UNSDCF. 

I would like to thank DCO HQ and Regional teams, UNCT, OMT and TWGs in Zambia for their invaluable efforts and support throughout this exercise. I encourage the Head of Agencies (HoAs) and the OMT to increase the efforts made to accelerate the implementation of the BOS to achieve the estimated cost avoidance and expected benefits.

As we start the first year of implementation of our Cooperation Framework, the successful implementation of the BOS is expected to yield several results, including economies of scales, customer service orientation of the service delivery, cost savings and quality enhancements and digitalization of our operations. It is therefore important to strengthen our collaborative efforts in implementing the BOS to reduce transactional costs, enhancing operational efficiency and effectiveness of UN operations in Zambia in support of the long-term national development priorities set out in the eight National Development Plan (8NDP).

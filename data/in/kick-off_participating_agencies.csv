sought to continually build on the comparative advantage of all UN Agencies,
Funds and Programmes to tackle the development and humanitarian challenges in
country. Until 15 August 2021, the One UN Framework for Afghanistan steered the
UN Country Team on enhancing the UN’s contribution to the Sustainable
Development Goals, under the guidance of an empowered and impartial Resident
Coordinator. The August 2021 power shift in Afghanistan has created the need
for a transitional strategy for the UN to address the deepening political and
social-economic instability. Afghanistan is still confronting an unprecedented
humanitarian crisis with a very real risk of systemic collapse and human
catastrophe that threatens to cancel many of the development gains of the last
twenty years. To this end, the UN and its partners had developed the one-year Transitional
Engagement Framework (TEF) as overarching strategic planning document for the
UN system’s assistance for 2022 which has been extended to June 2023. It
provides strategic direction and coherence; ensures UN coordination,
collaboration, and complementarity of action; and provides a basis for joint
risk-sharing and accountability. Looking ahead, the UN in Afghanistan with its
partners is currently developing a medium-term strategy for 2023-2025, building
on the TEF to continue advancing recovery and resilience in Afghanistan. The
new framework developed jointly with development partners will provide
strategic direction and coherence; ensure coordination, collaboration, and
complementarity between humanitarian, development, and peace approaches of the
international community; and provide a basis for joint risk-sharing and
accountability for interventions on basic human needs and rights. This
framework, the review of the Common Country Analysis (CCA) as well as the Business
Operations Strategy (BOS) are opportunities to guide and focus the work
of&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;

sought to continually build on the comparative advantage of all UN Agencies,
Funds and Programmes to tackle the development and humanitarian challenges in
country. Until 15 August 2021, the One UN Framework for Afghanistan steered the
UN Country Team on enhancing the UN’s contribution to the Sustainable
Development Goals, under the guidance of an empowered and impartial Resident
Coordinator. The August 2021 power shift in Afghanistan has created the need
for a transitional strategy for the UN to address the deepening political and
social-economic instability. Afghanistan is still confronting an unprecedented
humanitarian crisis with a very real risk of systemic collapse and human
catastrophe that threatens to cancel many of the development gains of the last
twenty years. To this end, the UN and its partners had developed the one-year Transitional
Engagement Framework (TEF) as overarching strategic planning document for the
UN system’s assistance for 2022 which has been extended to June 2023. It
provides strategic direction and coherence; ensures UN coordination,
collaboration, and complementarity of action; and provides a basis for joint
risk-sharing and accountability. Looking ahead, the UN in Afghanistan with its
partners is currently developing a medium-term strategy for 2023-2025, building
on the TEF to continue advancing recovery and resilience in Afghanistan. The
new framework developed jointly with development partners will provide
strategic direction and coherence; ensure coordination, collaboration, and
complementarity between humanitarian, development, and peace approaches of the
international community; and provide a basis for joint risk-sharing and
accountability for interventions on basic human needs and rights. This
framework, the review of the Common Country Analysis (CCA) as well as the Business

UN Country Team on enhancing the UN’s contribution to the Sustainable
Development Goals, under the guidance of an empowered and impartial Resident
Coordinator. The August 2021 power shift in Afghanistan has created the need
for a transitional strategy for the UN to address the deepening political and
social-economic instability. Afghanistan is still confronting an unprecedented
humanitarian crisis with a very real risk of systemic collapse and human
catastrophe that threatens to cancel many of the development gains of the last
twenty years. To this end, the UN and its partners had developed the one-year Transitional
Engagement Framework (TEF) as overarching strategic planning document for the
UN system’s assistance for 2022 which has been extended to June 2023. It
provides strategic direction and coherence; ensures UN coordination,
collaboration, and complementarity of action; and provides a basis for joint
risk-sharing and accountability. Looking ahead, the UN in Afghanistan with its
partners is currently developing a medium-term strategy for 2023-2025, building
on the TEF to continue advancing recovery and resilience in Afghanistan. The
new framework developed jointly with development partners will provide
strategic direction and coherence; ensure coordination, collaboration, and
complementarity between humanitarian, development, and peace approaches of the
international community; and provide a basis for joint risk-sharing and
accountability for interventions on basic human needs and rights. This

UN Country Team on enhancing the UN’s contribution to the Sustainable
Development Goals, under the guidance of an empowered and impartial Resident
Coordinator. The August 2021 power shift in Afghanistan has created the need
for a transitional strategy for the UN to address the deepening political and
social-economic instability. Afghanistan is still confronting an unprecedented
humanitarian crisis with a very real risk of systemic collapse and human
catastrophe that threatens to cancel many of the development gains of the last
twenty years. To this end, the UN and its partners had developed the one-year Transitional
Engagement Framework (TEF) as overarching strategic planning document for the
UN system’s assistance for 2022 which has been extended to June 2023. It
provides strategic direction and coherence; ensures UN coordination,
collaboration, and complementarity of action; and provides a basis for joint
risk-sharing and accountability. Looking ahead, the UN in Afghanistan with its
partners is currently developing a medium-term strategy for 2023-2025, building
on the TEF to continue advancing recovery and resilience in Afghanistan. The
new framework developed jointly with development partners will provide
strategic direction and coherence; ensure coordination, collaboration, and
complementarity between humanitarian, development, and peace approaches of the
international community; and provide a basis for joint risk-sharing and
accountability for interventions on basic human needs and rights. This

UN Country Team on enhancing the UN’s contribution to the Sustainable

Coordinator. The August 2021 power shift in Afghanistan has created the need
for a transitional strategy for the UN to address the deepening political and
social-economic instability. Afghanistan is still confronting an unprecedented
humanitarian crisis with a very real risk of systemic collapse and human
catastrophe that threatens to cancel many of the development gains of the last
twenty years. To this end, the UN and its partners had developed the one-year Transitional
Engagement Framework (TEF) as overarching strategic planning document for the
UN system’s assistance for 2022 which has been extended to June 2023. It
provides strategic direction and coherence; ensures UN coordination,
collaboration, and complementarity of action; and provides a basis for joint
risk-sharing and accountability. Looking ahead, the UN in Afghanistan with its
partners is currently developing a medium-term strategy for 2023-2025, building
on the TEF to continue advancing recovery and resilience in Afghanistan. The
new framework developed jointly with development partners will provide
strategic direction and coherence; ensure coordination, collaboration, and
complementarity between humanitarian, development, and peace approaches of the
international community; and provide a basis for joint risk-sharing and
accountability for interventions on basic human needs and rights. This

sought to continually build on the comparative advantage of all UN Agencies,

UN Country Team on enhancing the UN’s contribution to the Sustainable
Development Goals, under the guidance of an empowered and impartial Resident
Coordinator. The August 2021 power shift in Afghanistan has created the need
for a transitional strategy for the UN to address the deepening political and
social-economic instability. Afghanistan is still confronting an unprecedented
humanitarian crisis with a very real risk of systemic collapse and human
catastrophe that threatens to cancel many of the development gains of the last
twenty years. To this end, the UN and its partners had developed the one-year Transitional
Engagement Framework (TEF) as overarching strategic planning document for the
UN system’s assistance for 2022 which has been extended to June 2023. It
provides strategic direction and coherence; ensures UN coordination,
collaboration, and complementarity of action; and provides a basis for joint
risk-sharing and accountability. Looking ahead, the UN in Afghanistan with its
partners is currently developing a medium-term strategy for 2023-2025, building
on the TEF to continue advancing recovery and resilience in Afghanistan. The
new framework developed jointly with development partners will provide
strategic direction and coherence; ensure coordination, collaboration, and
complementarity between humanitarian, development, and peace approaches of the
international community; and provide a basis for joint risk-sharing and
accountability for interventions on basic human needs and rights. This

UN Country Team on enhancing the UN’s contribution to the Sustainable

Coordinator. The August 2021 power shift in Afghanistan has created the need
for a transitional strategy for the UN to address the deepening political and
social-economic instability. Afghanistan is still confronting an unprecedented
humanitarian crisis with a very real risk of systemic collapse and human
catastrophe that threatens to cancel many of the development gains of the last
twenty years. To this end, the UN and its partners had developed the one-year Transitional
Engagement Framework (TEF) as overarching strategic planning document for the
UN system’s assistance for 2022 which has been extended to June 2023. It
provides strategic direction and coherence; ensures UN coordination,
collaboration, and complementarity of action; and provides a basis for joint
risk-sharing and accountability. Looking ahead, the UN in Afghanistan with its
partners is currently developing a medium-term strategy for 2023-2025, building
on the TEF to continue advancing recovery and resilience in Afghanistan. The
new framework developed jointly with development partners will provide
strategic direction and coherence; ensure coordination, collaboration, and
complementarity between humanitarian, development, and peace approaches of the
international community; and provide a basis for joint risk-sharing and

UN Country Team on enhancing the UN’s contribution to the Sustainable

Coordinator. The August 2021 power shift in Afghanistan has created the need
for a transitional strategy for the UN to address the deepening political and
social-economic instability. Afghanistan is still confronting an unprecedented
humanitarian crisis with a very real risk of systemic collapse and human
catastrophe that threatens to cancel many of the development gains of the last
twenty years. To this end, the UN and its partners had developed the one-year Transitional
Engagement Framework (TEF) as overarching strategic planning document for the
UN system’s assistance for 2022 which has been extended to June 2023. It
provides strategic direction and coherence; ensures UN coordination,
collaboration, and complementarity of action; and provides a basis for joint
risk-sharing and accountability. Looking ahead, the UN in Afghanistan with its
partners is currently developing a medium-term strategy for 2023-2025, building
on the TEF to continue advancing recovery and resilience in Afghanistan. The
new framework developed jointly with development partners will provide
strategic direction and coherence; ensure coordination, collaboration, and
complementarity between humanitarian, development, and peace approaches of the
international community; and provide a basis for joint risk-sharing and

sought to continually build on the comparative advantage of all UN Agencies,
Funds and Programmes to tackle the development and humanitarian challenges in
country. Until 15 August 2021, the One UN Framework for Afghanistan steered the
UN Country Team on enhancing the UN’s contribution to the Sustainable
Development Goals, under the guidance of an empowered and impartial Resident
Coordinator. The August 2021 power shift in Afghanistan has created the need
for a transitional strategy for the UN to address the deepening political and
social-economic instability. Afghanistan is still confronting an unprecedented
humanitarian crisis with a very real risk of systemic collapse and human
catastrophe that threatens to cancel many of the development gains of the last
twenty years. To this end, the UN and its partners had developed the one-year Transitional
Engagement Framework (TEF) as overarching strategic planning document for the
UN system’s assistance for 2022 which has been extended to June 2023. It
provides strategic direction and coherence; ensures UN coordination,
collaboration, and complementarity of action; and provides a basis for joint
risk-sharing and accountability. Looking ahead, the UN in Afghanistan with its
partners is currently developing a medium-term strategy for 2023-2025, building
on the TEF to continue advancing recovery and resilience in Afghanistan. The
new framework developed jointly with development partners will provide
strategic direction and coherence; ensure coordination, collaboration, and
complementarity between humanitarian, development, and peace approaches of the
international community; and provide a basis for joint risk-sharing and
accountability for interventions on basic human needs and rights. This
framework, the review of the Common Country Analysis (CCA) as well as the Business
Operations Strategy (BOS) are opportunities to guide and focus the work
of&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;

UN Country Team on enhancing the UN’s contribution to the Sustainable
Development Goals, under the guidance of an empowered and impartial Resident
Coordinator. The August 2021 power shift in Afghanistan has created the need
for a transitional strategy for the UN to address the deepening political and
social-economic instability. Afghanistan is still confronting an unprecedented
humanitarian crisis with a very real risk of systemic collapse and human
catastrophe that threatens to cancel many of the development gains of the last
twenty years. To this end, the UN and its partners had developed the one-year Transitional
Engagement Framework (TEF) as overarching strategic planning document for the
UN system’s assistance for 2022 which has been extended to June 2023. It
provides strategic direction and coherence; ensures UN coordination,
collaboration, and complementarity of action; and provides a basis for joint
risk-sharing and accountability. Looking ahead, the UN in Afghanistan with its
partners is currently developing a medium-term strategy for 2023-2025, building
on the TEF to continue advancing recovery and resilience in Afghanistan. The
new framework developed jointly with development partners will provide
strategic direction and coherence; ensure coordination, collaboration, and
complementarity between humanitarian, development, and peace approaches of the
international community; and provide a basis for joint risk-sharing and
accountability for interventions on basic human needs and rights. This

UN Country Team on enhancing the UN’s contribution to the Sustainable

Coordinator. The August 2021 power shift in Afghanistan has created the need
for a transitional strategy for the UN to address the deepening political and

humanitarian crisis with a very real risk of systemic collapse and human
catastrophe that threatens to cancel many of the development gains of the last
twenty years. To this end, the UN and its partners had developed the one-year Transitional
Engagement Framework (TEF) as overarching strategic planning document for the
UN system’s assistance for 2022 which has been extended to June 2023. It
provides strategic direction and coherence; ensures UN coordination,
collaboration, and complementarity of action; and provides a basis for joint
risk-sharing and accountability. Looking ahead, the UN in Afghanistan with its
partners is currently developing a medium-term strategy for 2023-2025, building
on the TEF to continue advancing recovery and resilience in Afghanistan. The
new framework developed jointly with development partners will provide
strategic direction and coherence; ensure coordination, collaboration, and
complementarity between humanitarian, development, and peace approaches of the
international community; and provide a basis for joint risk-sharing and
accountability for interventions on basic human needs and rights. This

UN Country Team on enhancing the UN’s contribution to the Sustainable

Coordinator. The August 2021 power shift in Afghanistan has created the need
for a transitional strategy for the UN to address the deepening political and
social-economic instability. Afghanistan is still confronting an unprecedented
humanitarian crisis with a very real risk of systemic collapse and human
catastrophe that threatens to cancel many of the development gains of the last
twenty years. To this end, the UN and its partners had developed the one-year Transitional
Engagement Framework (TEF) as overarching strategic planning document for the
UN system’s assistance for 2022 which has been extended to June 2023. It
provides strategic direction and coherence; ensures UN coordination,
collaboration, and complementarity of action; and provides a basis for joint
risk-sharing and accountability. Looking ahead, the UN in Afghanistan with its
partners is currently developing a medium-term strategy for 2023-2025, building
on the TEF to continue advancing recovery and resilience in Afghanistan. The
new framework developed jointly with development partners will provide
strategic direction and coherence; ensure coordination, collaboration, and
complementarity between humanitarian, development, and peace approaches of the
international community; and provide a basis for joint risk-sharing and
accountability for interventions on basic human needs and rights. This

for a transitional strategy for the UN to address the deepening political and

humanitarian crisis with a very real risk of systemic collapse and human
catastrophe that threatens to cancel many of the development gains of the last
twenty years. To this end, the UN and its partners had developed the one-year Transitional
Engagement Framework (TEF) as overarching strategic planning document for the
UN system’s assistance for 2022 which has been extended to June 2023. It
provides strategic direction and coherence; ensures UN coordination,
collaboration, and complementarity of action; and provides a basis for joint
risk-sharing and accountability. Looking ahead, the UN in Afghanistan with its
partners is currently developing a medium-term strategy for 2023-2025, building
on the TEF to continue advancing recovery and resilience in Afghanistan. The
new framework developed jointly with development partners will provide
strategic direction and coherence; ensure coordination, collaboration, and
complementarity between humanitarian, development, and peace approaches of the
international community; and provide a basis for joint risk-sharing and

for a transitional strategy for the UN to address the deepening political and

humanitarian crisis with a very real risk of systemic collapse and human
catastrophe that threatens to cancel many of the development gains of the last
twenty years. To this end, the UN and its partners had developed the one-year Transitional
Engagement Framework (TEF) as overarching strategic planning document for the
UN system’s assistance for 2022 which has been extended to June 2023. It
provides strategic direction and coherence; ensures UN coordination,
collaboration, and complementarity of action; and provides a basis for joint
risk-sharing and accountability. Looking ahead, the UN in Afghanistan with its
partners is currently developing a medium-term strategy for 2023-2025, building
on the TEF to continue advancing recovery and resilience in Afghanistan. The
new framework developed jointly with development partners will provide
strategic direction and coherence; ensure coordination, collaboration, and
complementarity between humanitarian, development, and peace approaches of the
international community; and provide a basis for joint risk-sharing and
